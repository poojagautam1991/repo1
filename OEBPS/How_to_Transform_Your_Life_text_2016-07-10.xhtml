			<p id="_idParaDest-8" class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_00-Chapter-title---TOC-Level-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>How to Develop and Maintain a Peaceful Mind</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">We can develop and maintain a <a id="_idIndexMarker074"></a>peaceful mind by transforming our mind from negative states into positive states through engaging in the pure spiritual practices that are presented in this book. Through this we can transform our life from a miserable state into a state of pure and everlasting happiness. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para"><a id="_idIndexMarker075"></a>Happiness and <a id="_idIndexMarker076"></a>suffering are parts of the mind; the former is a joyful feeling and the latter an unpleasant feeling. Since happiness and suffering are parts of the mind, if we want to avoid suffering and find true happiness we need to understand the nature and functions of the mind. At first, this might seem to be quite straightforward since we all have minds, and we all know what state our mind is in – whether it is happy or sad, clear or confused, and so forth. However, if someone were to ask us what the nature of our mind is and how it functions, we would probably not be able to give a precise answer. This indicates that we do not have a clear understanding of the mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Some people think that the <a id="_idIndexMarker077"></a>mind is the brain or some other part or function of the <a id="_idIndexMarker078"></a>body, but this is incorrect. The brain is a physical object that can be seen with the eyes and that can be photographed or operated on in surgery. The mind, on the other hand, is not a physical object. It cannot be seen with the eyes, nor can it be photographed or repaired by surgery. The brain, therefore, is not the mind but simply part of the body.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">There is nothing within the body that can be identified as being our mind because our body and <a id="_idIndexMarker079"></a>mind are different entities. For example, sometimes when our body is relaxed and immobile, our mind can be very busy, darting from one object to another. This indicates that our body and mind are not the same entity. In Buddhist scriptures, our body is compared to a guest house and our mind to a guest dwelling within it. When we die our mind leaves our body and goes to the next life, like a guest leaving a guesthouse and going somewhere else.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If the mind is not the brain, nor any other part of the body, what is it? It is a formless continuum that functions to perceive and understand objects. Because the mind is formless, or non-physical, by nature, it is not obstructed by physical objects. Thus, it is impossible for our body to go to the moon without travelling in a spaceship, but our mind can reach the moon in an instant just by thinking about it. Knowing and perceiving objects is a function that is unique to the mind. Although we say, ‘I know such and such’, in reality it is our mind that knows. We know things only by using our mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">It is very important to be able to distinguish disturbed states of mind from peaceful states. As explained in the previous chapter, states of mind that disturb our inner peace, such as anger, jealousy and desirous attachment, are called ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker080"></a>delusions’, and these are the principal causes of all our <a id="_idIndexMarker081"></a>suffering. We may think that our suffering is caused by other people, by poor material conditions or by society, but in reality it all comes from our own deluded states of mind. The essence of <a id="_idIndexMarker082"></a>spiritual practice is to reduce and eventually completely eradicate our delusions, and replace them with permanent inner <a id="_idIndexMarker083"></a>peace. This is the real meaning of our <a id="_idIndexMarker084"></a>human life.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Normally we seek <a id="_idIndexMarker085"></a>happiness outside ourself. We try to obtain better material conditions, a better job, higher social status and so forth; but no matter how successful we are in improving our external situation, we still experience many problems and much dissatisfaction. We never experience pure, lasting happiness. This shows us that we should not seek happiness outside ourself, but instead establish it within by purifying and <a id="_idIndexMarker086"></a>controlling our <a id="_idIndexMarker087"></a>mind through sincere <a id="_idIndexMarker088"></a>spiritual practice. If we train in this way we can ensure that our mind remains calm and happy all the time. Then, no matter how difficult our external circumstances may be, we will always be happy and peaceful.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">In our ordinary life, even though we work very hard to find happiness it remains elusive for us, whereas suffering and problems seem to come naturally, without any effort. Why is this? It is because the cause of happiness within our mind – inner peace – is very weak and can give rise to its effect only if we apply great effort, whereas the internal causes of suffering and <a id="_idIndexMarker089"></a>problems – the delusions – are very strong and can give rise to their effects with no effort on our part. This is the real reason why problems come naturally while happiness is so difficult to find.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">From this we can see that the principal causes of both happiness and <a id="_idIndexMarker090"></a>problems are in the mind, not in the external world. If we were able to maintain a calm and peaceful mind all day long we would never experience any problems or mental suffering. For example, if our mind remains peaceful all the time, then even if we are insulted, criticized or blamed, or if we lose our job or our friends, we will not become unhappy. No matter how difficult our <a id="_idIndexMarker091"></a>external circumstances may become, for as long as we maintain a calm and peaceful mind they will not be a problem for us. Therefore, if we wish to be free from problems there is only one thing to do – learn to maintain a peaceful state of mind by following the spiritual path.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The essential point of understanding the mind is that liberation from suffering cannot be found outside the mind. Permanent <a id="_idIndexMarker092"></a>liberation can be found only by purifying the mind. Therefore, if we want to become free from problems and attain lasting peace and happiness we need to increase our knowledge and understanding of how our mind develops.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">There are three different levels of <a id="_idIndexMarker093"></a>mind: gross, subtle and very subtle. During our dreams, we have dream awareness through which the various kinds of dream things appear to us; this awareness is a subtle mind because it is difficult to recognize. During deep <a id="_idIndexMarker094"></a>sleep we have only one mental awareness, which perceives emptiness alone. This awareness is called the ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker095"></a>clear light of sleep’, and is a very subtle mind because it is extremely difficult to recognize.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">During the waking day we have waking awareness through which various kinds of waking things appear to us. This awareness is a gross mind because it is not difficult to recognize. When we fall asleep our gross mind, or waking awareness, dissolves into our subtle mind of sleep. At the same time, all our appearances of the waking world become non-existent; and when we experience deep sleep, our subtle mind of sleep dissolves into our very subtle mind of sleep, the clear light of sleep. At this stage, we have become like a person who has died. Then, because of our maintaining a <a id="_idIndexMarker096"></a>karmic connection with this life, from our clear light of sleep our gross mind, or waking awareness, will arise again and various kinds of waking things appear to us again.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The process of sleeping is very similar to the process of dying. The difference between these two is that when we are dying our gross and subtle minds will dissolve into our very subtle <a id="_idIndexMarker097"></a>mind of death, known as the ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker098"></a>clear light of death’. Then, because of our <a id="_idIndexMarker099"></a>karmic connection with this life ceasing, our very subtle mind leaves this body, goes to the next life and enters a new body, and then all the various kinds of things of the next life will appear to us. Everything will be completely new.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Living beings experience countless thoughts or minds, all of which are included within two: primary <a id="_idIndexMarker100"></a>minds and <a id="_idIndexMarker101"></a>mental factors. A detailed explanation of these can be found in the book <span class="_1---Italic">How to Understand the Mind</span>.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para _idGenParaOverride-1">If we understand clearly the nature of our mind, we will definitely realize that the <a id="_idIndexMarker102"></a>continuum of our mind does not cease when we die, and there will be no basis for doubting the existence of our <a id="_idIndexMarker103"></a>future lives. If we realize the existence of our future lives, we will naturally be concerned for our welfare and happiness in those lives, and we will use this present life to make the appropriate preparations. This will prevent us from wasting our <a id="_idIndexMarker104"></a>precious human life on the preoccupations of this life alone. Therefore, a correct understanding of the mind is absolutely essential.</p>
