			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">We should know that our <a id="_idIndexMarker106"></a>sleeping is like <a id="_idIndexMarker107"></a>death, our dreaming is like the intermediate state between death and rebirth, and our waking up is like rebirth. The cycle of these three shows the existence of future rebirth, through which we can understand the existence of our countless future lives. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Many people believe that when the body disintegrates at <a id="_idIndexMarker108"></a>death, the <a id="_idIndexMarker109"></a>continuum of the <a id="_idIndexMarker110"></a>mind ceases and the mind becomes non-existent, like a candle flame going out when all the wax has burned. There are even some people who contemplate committing <a id="_idIndexMarker111"></a>suicide in the hope that if they die their problems and sufferings will come to an end. These ideas, however, are completely wrong. As already explained, our <a id="_idIndexMarker112"></a>body and mind are separate entities, and so even though the body disintegrates at death, the continuum of the mind remains unbroken. Instead of ceasing, the mind simply leaves the present body and goes to the next life. For <a id="_idIndexMarker113"></a>ordinary beings, therefore, rather than releasing us from suffering, death only brings new sufferings. Not understanding this, many people destroy their <a id="_idIndexMarker114"></a>precious human life by committing suicide.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">There is a special spiritual practice called ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker115"></a>transference of consciousness into another body’, which was quite widespread in ancient times. There are many examples of past practitioners who could transfer their consciousness from their normal body into another body. If mind and body were the same entity, how would it be possible for these practitioners to transfer their consciousness in this way? Even now, it is not that unusual for the mind temporarily to leave the physical body before death. For example, many people who are not spiritual practitioners have had so-called ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker116"></a>out of body’ experiences.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We can also gain an understanding of past and future lives by examining the process of <a id="_idIndexMarker117"></a>sleeping, dreaming and waking, because this closely resembles the process of <a id="_idIndexMarker118"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker119"></a>death, <a id="_idIndexMarker120"></a>intermediate state and rebirth. When we fall asleep, our gross <a id="_idIndexMarker121"></a>inner winds gather and dissolve inwards, and our mind becomes progressively more and more subtle until it transforms into the very subtle <a id="_idIndexMarker122"></a>mind of the clear light of sleep. While the <a id="_idIndexMarker123"></a>clear light of sleep is manifest, we experience deep sleep, and to others we resemble a dead person. When it ends our mind becomes gradually more and more gross and we pass through the various levels of the <a id="_idIndexMarker124"></a>dream state. Finally, our normal powers of memory and mental control are restored and we wake up. When this happens, our dream <a id="_idIndexMarker125"></a>world disappears and we perceive the world of the waking state.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">A very similar process occurs when we die. As we die, our inner winds dissolve inwards and our mind becomes progressively more and more subtle until the very subtle mind of the clear light of death becomes manifest. The experience of the clear light of death is very similar to the experience of deep sleep. After the clear light of death has ceased, we experience the stages of the intermediate state, which is a dream-like state that occurs between death and rebirth. After a few days or weeks, the intermediate state ends and we take rebirth. Just as when we wake from sleep, the dream world disappears and we perceive the world of the waking state, so, when we take rebirth, the appearances of the intermediate state cease and we perceive the world of our next life.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The only significant difference between the process of sleeping, dreaming and waking and the process of death, intermediate state and rebirth is that after the clear light of sleep has ceased, the relationship between our <a id="_idIndexMarker126"></a>mind and our present body remains intact, whereas after the clear light of death has ceased this relationship is broken. By contemplating this, we can gain a clear understanding of the existence of past and future lives.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We generally believe that the things we perceive in dreams are unreal whereas the things we perceive when we are awake are true; but in reality everything we perceive is like a dream in that it is <a id="_idIndexMarker127"></a>mere appearance to mind. For those who can interpret them correctly, <a id="_idIndexMarker128"></a>dreams have great significance. For example, if we dream that we visit a particular country to which we have not been in this life, our dream will indicate one of four things: that we have been to that country in a previous life, that we will visit it later in this life, that we will visit it in a future life, or that it has some personal significance for us, as it would, for example, if we had recently received a letter from that country or had seen a television programme about it. Similarly, if we dream we are flying, it may mean that in a previous life we were a being who could fly, such as a bird or a meditator with miracle powers, or it may predict that we will become such a being in the future. A flying dream may also have a less literal meaning, symbolizing an improvement in our health or state of mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">It was with the help of dreams that I was able to discover where my mother was reborn after she had died. Just before she died, my <a id="_idIndexMarker129"></a>mother dozed off for a few minutes and when she woke she told my sister, who was attending her, that she had dreamed of me and that in her dream I had offered her a traditional white scarf. I took this dream to mean that I would be able to help my mother in her next life and so, after she died, I prayed every day for her to be reborn in England, where I was living, so that I would have the opportunity to meet and recognize her reincarnation. I made strong prayers to see clear signs of where my mother’s reincarnation could be found.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Later, I had three dreams that seemed to be significant. In the first, I dreamed that I met my mother in a place I took to be England. I asked her how she had travelled from India to England, but she replied that she had come not from India but from Switzerland. In the second dream, I dreamed that I saw my mother talking to a group of people. I approached her and spoke to her in Tibetan, but she did not seem to understand what I was saying. While she was alive, my mother spoke only Tibetan, but in this dream she spoke English fluently. I asked her why she had forgotten Tibetan, but she did not reply. Later in the same dream, I dreamed of a western couple who were helping me with the development of my spiritual activities in Britain.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Both dreams seemed to give clues as to where my mother had been reborn. Two days after the second dream, the husband of the couple of whom I had dreamed visited me and told me that his wife was pregnant. I immediately remembered my dream and thought that her baby might be my mother’s reincarnation. The fact that in the dream my mother had forgotten Tibetan and spoke only English suggested that she would be reborn in an English-speaking country, and the presence of this couple in the dream might have been an indication that they were her parents. I then performed a traditional divination together with ritual prayers, and this indicated that their child was my mother’s reincarnation. I was very happy but did not say anything to anyone.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">One night I dreamed about my mother again and again. The next morning I considered the matter carefully and reached a decision. If the baby had been born that night, then it was definitely my mother’s reincarnation, but if it had not, I would need to make further examinations. Having made this decision, I telephoned the husband, who gave me the good news that his wife had given birth to a baby girl the previous night. I was delighted and performed a special offering ceremony.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">A few days later, the father telephoned and told me that if he recited the <a id="_idIndexMarker130"></a>mantra of Buddha <a id="_idIndexMarker131"></a>Avalokiteshvara, <span class="_1---Small-Caps _idGenCharOverride-1">OM MANI PÄME HUM</span>, when the baby cried, she would immediately stop crying and appear to be listening to the mantra. He asked me why this was and I replied that it was because of her tendencies from her previous life. I knew that my mother had recited this mantra with strong faith throughout her life.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The child was named Amaravajra. Later, when my mother’s brother, Kuten Lama, visited England and saw Amaravajra for the first time, he was astonished by how affectionate she was towards him. He said that it was as if she recognized him. I also had the same experience. Although I was able to visit the young child only very occasionally, she was always extremely happy to see me.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">When Amaravajra started to talk, one day she pointed to a dog and said, ‘kyi, kyi’. After this she used to say ‘kyi’ many times whenever she saw a dog. Her father asked me if ‘kyi’ meant anything and I told him that in the dialect of western Tibet, which is where my mother lived, ‘kyi’ means ‘dog’. This was not the only Tibetan word the little girl uttered spontaneously.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">I later heard through my sister’s husband that after my mother’s death, a Tibetan astrologer had predicted that my mother would be born as a female in a country with a language other than Tibetan. This story comes from my own personal experience, but if we investigate we can find many other true stories about how people have been able to recognize the reincarnations of their husband, wife, Teachers, parents, friends and others.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">In Western Tibet, near my first monastery, there lived a man who had a reputation for being very bad tempered. He collected many silver coins and put them into a teapot, which he kept a secret even from his wife. Later, as he lay dying, out of attachment for the coins he became obsessed with the thought that they might be stolen. He tried to tell his wife about the coins, but because he was very weak he could only repeat the one word ‘tib’, which means ‘teapot’. Hearing this, his wife assumed that he wanted some tea, but when she offered him some he had no interest in it. Shortly afterwards he died.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Sometime later, the wife found the hidden <a id="_idIndexMarker132"></a>teapot. Wondering why it was so heavy, she opened the lid and discovered the coins. Coiled around these was a small snake. Terrified of the snake, she called for her family, who together tried to remove it from the teapot. Yet however hard they tried they could not part the snake from the coins. They were surprised and confused about this, and wondered where the snake had come from.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The wife then remembered her husband’s last words, and realized that at the time of his death he had been trying to tell her about the coins. Yet what about the snake? Why was it so attached to the coins? She decided to visit a clairvoyant <a id="_idIndexMarker133"></a>Yogi living nearby, who told her that the snake was the reincarnation of her husband. Due to the actions he had created out of anger, and due to his attachment to the coins when he was about to die, he had taken rebirth as a snake and had gone inside the teapot to be close to the coins. With tears falling from her eyes, she beseeched the Yogi, ‘Please tell me what I can do to help my husband.’ He suggested that she offer the coins to the nearby community of ordained Sangha, requesting them to pray for her husband to be released from his <a id="_idIndexMarker134"></a>animal rebirth.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para _idGenParaOverride-1">By contemplating such stories with a positive mind, and reflecting on the nature of the mind and the analogy of sleeping, dreaming and waking, we will definitely gain a deep understanding of the existence of our <a id="_idIndexMarker135"></a>future lives. This knowledge is very precious and helps us to gain great wisdom. We will understand that the <a id="_idIndexMarker136"></a>happiness of future lives is more important than the happiness of this life for the simple reason that countless future lives are far longer than this one short human life. This will motivate us to prepare for the happiness of our countless future lives, or to apply effort to attaining permanent liberation from suffering by abandoning our delusions.</p>
