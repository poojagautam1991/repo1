			<p id="_idParaDest-11" class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_00-Chapter-title---TOC-Level-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Karma</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">Karma means actions: the actions of our body, speech and mind. This subject is very meaningful. Throughout our life we have to experience various kinds of suffering and problems without choice. This is because we do not understand what actions we need to abandon and what actions we need to practise. If we had this knowledge and put it into practice there would be no basis for experiencing suffering and problems. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The law of <a id="_idIndexMarker188"></a>karma is a special instance of the law of <a id="_idIndexMarker189"></a>cause and effect, according to which all our actions of body, speech and mind are causes and all our experiences are their effects. The law of karma explains why each individual has a unique mental disposition, a unique physical appearance and unique experiences. These are the various effects of the countless actions that each individual has performed in the past. We cannot find any two people who have created exactly the same history of actions throughout their past lives, and so we cannot find two people with identical states of mind, identical experiences or identical physical appearances. Each person has a different individual karma. Some people enjoy good health while others are constantly ill. Some people are seen as very beautiful while others are seen as very ugly. Some people have a happy disposition that is easily pleased while others have a sour disposition and are rarely delighted by anything. Some people easily understand the meaning of spiritual <a id="_idIndexMarker190"></a>teachings while others find them difficult and obscure.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Every action we perform leaves an <a id="_idIndexMarker191"></a>imprint, or potentiality, on our very subtle mind, and each imprint eventually gives rise to its own effect. Our mind is like a field, and performing actions is like sowing seeds in that field. <a id="_idIndexMarker192"></a>Virtuous actions sow seeds of future <a id="_idIndexMarker193"></a>happiness and non-virtuous actions sow seeds of future <a id="_idIndexMarker194"></a>suffering. These seeds remain dormant in our mind until the conditions for them to ripen occur, and then they produce their effect. In some cases, this can happen many lifetimes after the original action was performed.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">It is because of our karma or <a id="_idIndexMarker195"></a>actions that we are born in this impure, contaminated <a id="_idIndexMarker196"></a>world and experience so many difficulties and problems. Our <a id="_idIndexMarker197"></a>actions are impure because our mind is contaminated by the inner poison of <a id="_idIndexMarker198"></a>self-grasping. This is the fundamental reason why we experience suffering. Suffering is created by our own actions or karma – it is not given to us as a punishment. We suffer because we have accumulated many non-virtuous actions in our previous lives. The source of these <a id="_idIndexMarker199"></a>non-virtuous actions is our own delusions such as anger, attachment and self-grasping ignorance.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">Once we have purified our mind of self-grasping and all other delusions, all our <a id="_idIndexMarker200"></a>actions will naturally be pure. As a result of our pure actions or pure karma, everything we experience will be pure. We will abide in a pure <a id="_idIndexMarker201"></a>world, with a pure <a id="_idIndexMarker202"></a>body, enjoying pure enjoyments and surrounded by pure beings. There will no longer be the slightest trace of suffering, impurity or problems. This is how to find true <a id="_idIndexMarker203"></a>happiness from within our mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF <a id="_idIndexMarker204"></a>KARMA</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">For every action we perform, we experience a similar result. If a gardener sows a seed of a medicinal plant, a medicinal plant and not a poisonous one will grow; and if he or she does not sow any seeds, then nothing will grow. In a similar way, if we perform <a id="_idIndexMarker205"></a>positive actions we will experience happy results and not unhappiness, if we perform <a id="_idIndexMarker206"></a>negative actions we will experience only unhappy results, and if we perform <a id="_idIndexMarker207"></a>neutral actions we will experience neutral results.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">For example, if we now experience any mental disturbance it is because at some time in the past we disturbed the minds of others. If we experience a painful physical <a id="_idIndexMarker208"></a>illness it is because in the past we caused pain to others, such as by beating or shooting them, intentionally administering wrong medicines or serving them poisonous food. If we have not created the karmic cause to become ill it is impossible for us to experience the suffering of physical illness, even if we find ourself in the midst of an epidemic where everyone else around us is dying. Those who have attained <a id="_idIndexMarker209"></a>nirvana, the supreme permanent inner peace, for example, never experience any physical or mental pain because they have abandoned engaging in harmful actions and purified all the non-virtuous potentialities that are the main causes of pain.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The main cause of the sufferings of <a id="_idIndexMarker210"></a>poverty is an action of <a id="_idIndexMarker211"></a>stealing. The main causes of being oppressed are looking down on, beating or demanding work from people of inferior position, or despising others instead of showing them loving kindness. The main causes of the sufferings of being separated from friends and family are actions such as seducing other people’s partners or purposefully alienating their friends and the people who work for them.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Usually we assume that bad experiences arise only in dependence upon the conditions of this present life. Since we cannot account for many of them in these terms, we often feel that they are inexplicable and undeserved, and that there is no justice in the world. In reality, however, most of our experiences in this life are caused by actions we committed in past lives.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Through the following example given in Buddhist scriptures, we can begin to understand how our experiences in this life arise from actions in previous lives, as well as how the results of actions increase over time, just as a small seed can grow into a large tree. There was once a nun called <a id="_idIndexMarker212"></a>Upala who before her ordination experienced extraordinary misfortune. Of the two children she had by her first husband, one drowned and the other was savaged and eaten by a jackal. Her husband was later killed by a poisonous snake. After losing her family Upala returned to her parents’ home, but soon after she arrived the house caught fire and burnt to the ground. She married again and had a child by her second husband, but he was an alcoholic and one night he got so drunk that he killed his child and forced Upala to eat its flesh. She fled from this crazy man and escaped to another country, where she was captured by a gang of thieves and forced to marry their leader. A few years later her third husband was caught and, in accordance with the custom of that country, she was buried alive with her husband. However, the thieves desired Upala so much they dug her up and forced her to live with them. Having experienced all these terrible miseries and misfortunes, Upala developed a very strong wish to find freedom from every kind of suffering existence and went in search of Buddha to tell him her story. Buddha explained that in her previous life she had been one of the wives of a king and that she had been very jealous of the other wives. Her jealousy alone was enough to cause the terrible sufferings of her present life. Buddha then explained how she could purify her mind, and by sincerely practising these teachings she attained <a id="_idIndexMarker213"></a>nirvana in that life.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">By contemplating how the results of our actions are definite and how they increase, we will develop a strong determination to avoid even the slightest non-virtue and to nurture even the smallest positive thoughts and constructive deeds. We then meditate on this determination to make it constant and stable. If we can keep our determination all the time and put it into practice, our <a id="_idIndexMarker214"></a>actions of body, speech and mind will become increasingly more pure until there is no longer any basis for suffering. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If we do not perform an action, we cannot experience its effect. In a battle, some soldiers are killed while others survive. The survivors are not saved because they are braver than the others, but because they did not create any action that would cause them to die at that time. We can find many other such examples in the daily news. When a terrorist plants a bomb in a large building, some people are killed while others escape despite being at the centre of the blast. When there is an aeroplane crash or a volcanic eruption, some people are killed while others, as if by a miracle, escape. In many accidents the survivors themselves are astonished to be alive when others right next to them were killed.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The actions of living beings are never wasted, even though a long time may pass before their effects are experienced. Actions cannot simply vanish, and we cannot give them away to someone else and thus avoid our responsibility. Although the momentary mental intentions that initiated our past actions have ceased, the potentialities they have created in our mind do not cease until their results have ripened. The only way to destroy negative potentialities before they ripen as suffering is to <a id="_idIndexMarker215"></a>purify them.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">Unfortunately, it is easier to destroy our positive potentialities, for if we fail to <a id="_idIndexMarker216"></a>dedicate our virtuous actions they can be made completely powerless by just one moment of <a id="_idIndexMarker217"></a>anger. Our mind is like a treasure chest and our <a id="_idIndexMarker218"></a>virtuous actions are like jewels. If we do not safeguard them through dedication, whenever we become angry it is as if we had put a thief among our treasures. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">THE <a id="_idIndexMarker219"></a>SIX REALMS OF REBIRTH</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">The <a id="_idIndexMarker220"></a>seeds of our actions that ripen when we die are very important because they determine what kind of rebirth we will take in our next life. Which particular seed ripens at <a id="_idIndexMarker221"></a>death depends upon the state of mind in which we die. If we die with a peaceful mind, this will stimulate a virtuous seed and we will experience a fortunate <a id="_idIndexMarker222"></a>rebirth. However, if we die with an unpeaceful mind, such as in a state of anger, this will stimulate a non-virtuous seed and we will experience an unfortunate rebirth. This is similar to the way in which nightmares are triggered by our being in an agitated state of mind just before falling asleep.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The example of sleeping, dreaming and waking is not accidental, for, as explained in the chapter on rebirth, the process of <a id="_idIndexMarker223"></a>sleeping, dreaming and waking closely resembles the process of <a id="_idIndexMarker224"></a>death, <a id="_idIndexMarker225"></a>intermediate state and rebirth. While we are in the intermediate state, we experience different visions that arise from the <a id="_idIndexMarker226"></a>karmic seeds that were activated immediately before death. If negative seeds were activated, these visions will be nightmarish, but if positive seeds were activated they will be predominantly pleasant. In either case, when the karmic seeds have fully ripened they impel us to take rebirth in one or other of the six realms of samsara.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The six realms are actual places in which we can be reborn. They are brought into existence through the power of our actions, or karma. There are three types of <a id="_idIndexMarker227"></a>action: bodily actions, verbal actions and mental actions. Since our bodily and verbal actions are always initiated by our mental actions, or intentions, ultimately the six realms are created by our mind. For example, a <a id="_idIndexMarker228"></a>hell realm is a place that arises as a result of the worst actions, such as murder or extreme mental or physical cruelty, which depend upon the most deluded states of mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">To form a mental image of the six realms, we can compare them to the floors of a large, old house. In this analogy the house represents samsara, the cycle of contaminated <a id="_idIndexMarker229"></a>rebirth. The house has three storeys above ground and three below. Deluded sentient beings are like the inhabitants of this house. They are continually moving up and down the house, sometimes living above ground, sometimes below.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The ground floor represents the <a id="_idIndexMarker230"></a>human realm. Above this, on the first floor, is the realm of the <a id="_idIndexMarker231"></a>demi-gods – non-human beings who are continually at war with the <a id="_idIndexMarker232"></a>gods. In terms of power and prosperity they are superior to humans, but they are so obsessed with jealousy and violence that their lives have little spiritual value.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">On the top floor live the gods. The lower classes of gods, the <a id="_idIndexMarker233"></a>desire realm gods, live a life of ease and luxury, devoting their time to enjoyment and the satisfaction of their desires. Though their world is a paradise and their lifespan is very long, they are not immortal and they eventually fall to lower states. Since their lives are filled with <a id="_idIndexMarker234"></a>distractions, it is difficult for them to find the motivation to engage in spiritual practice. From a spiritual point of view, a human life is much more meaningful than a god’s life.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Higher than the desire realm gods are the gods of the <a id="_idIndexMarker235"></a>form and <a id="_idIndexMarker236"></a>formless realms. Having passed beyond sensual desire, the form realm gods experience the refined <a id="_idIndexMarker237"></a>bliss of meditative absorption and possess bodies made of light. Transcending even these subtle forms, the gods of the formless realm abide without form in a subtle consciousness that resembles infinite space. Though their minds are the purest and most exalted within samsara, they have not overcome the ignorance of self-grasping, which is the root of samsara, and so, after experiencing <a id="_idIndexMarker238"></a>bliss for many aeons, eventually their lives end and they are once again reborn in the lower states of samsara. Like the other gods, they consume the merit they have created in the past and make little or no spiritual progress.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The three storeys above ground are called ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker239"></a>fortunate realms’ because the beings who inhabit them have relatively pleasant experiences, which are caused by the practice of virtue. Below ground are the three <a id="_idIndexMarker240"></a>lower realms, which are the result of negative bodily, verbal and mental actions. The least painful of these is the <a id="_idIndexMarker241"></a>animal realm, which in this analogy is the first floor beneath the ground. Included in this realm are all mammals apart from humans, as well as birds, fish, insects, worms – the whole animal kingdom. Their minds are characterized by a complete lack of spiritual awareness, and their lives mainly by fear and brutality.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">On the next floor down live the <a id="_idIndexMarker242"></a>hungry ghosts, or hungry spirits. The principal causes of rebirth here are greed and negative actions motivated by miserliness. The consequence of these actions is extreme <a id="_idIndexMarker243"></a>poverty. Hungry ghosts suffer continuous hunger and thirst, which they are unable to bear. Their world is a vast desert. If by chance they come across a drop of water or a scrap of food, it disappears like a mirage or transforms into something repulsive, such as pus or urine. These appearances are due to their negative karma and lack of merit.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The lowest floor is <a id="_idIndexMarker244"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker245"></a>hell. The beings here experience unrelenting torment. Some hells are a mass of fire; others are desolate regions of ice and darkness. Monsters conjured up by the minds of the hell beings inflict terrible tortures on them. This suffering continues unremittingly for what seems an eternity, but eventually the karma that caused the beings to be born in hell is exhausted and the hell beings die and are reborn elsewhere in samsara. Hell is simply what appears to the most negative and distorted type of mind. It is not an external place that we can normally see, but is like a nightmare from which we do not wake up for a very long time. For those living in hell, the sufferings of the hell realm are as real as our present experience of the human realm.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">This is a general picture of samsara. We have been trapped in samsara since <a id="_idIndexMarker246"></a>beginningless time, wandering meaning-lessly, without any freedom or control, from the highest heaven to the deepest hell. Sometimes we dwell on the upper storeys as gods, sometimes we find ourself on the ground floor with a human rebirth, but most of the time we are trapped on the underground floors as animals, hungry ghosts or hell beings, experiencing terrible physical and mental suffering for very long periods of time.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">Although samsara resembles a prison, there is one <a id="_idIndexMarker247"></a>door through which we can escape. That door is <a id="_idIndexMarker248"></a>emptiness, the ultimate nature of phenomena. By realizing <a id="_idIndexMarker249"></a>emptiness we can escape from samsara. By training in the spiritual paths described in this book we will eventually find our way to this door and, stepping through, discover that the house was simply an <a id="_idIndexMarker250"></a>illusion, the creation of our impure <a id="_idIndexMarker251"></a>mind. <a id="_idIndexMarker252"></a>Samsara is not an external prison; it is a prison made by our own mind. It will never end by itself, but by diligently practising a pure <a id="_idIndexMarker253"></a>spiritual path, and thereby eliminating our self-grasping and other delusions, we can bring our samsara to an end. Once we attain <a id="_idIndexMarker254"></a>liberation, or <a id="_idIndexMarker255"></a>nirvana, ourself, we will then be in a position to show others how to destroy their mental prison by eradicating their delusions.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">TYPES OF <a id="_idIndexMarker256"></a>ACTION</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">Although there are countless different actions of body, speech and mind, all are included within three types: virtuous actions, non-virtuous actions and neutral actions. The practices of giving, moral discipline, patience, effort in spiritual training, meditative concentration and wisdom are examples of <a id="_idIndexMarker257"></a>virtuous actions. Killing, stealing and sexual misconduct are bodily non-virtuous <a id="_idIndexMarker258"></a>actions; lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech and idle chatter are verbal non-virtuous actions; and covetousness, malice and holding wrong views are mental non-virtuous actions. In addition to these ten <a id="_idIndexMarker259"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker260"></a>non-virtuous actions, there are many other kinds of non-virtuous action, such as beating or torturing others, or otherwise deliberately causing them to suffer. Every day we also perform many neutral actions. Whenever we engage in daily actions such as shopping, cooking, eating, sleeping or relaxing without a specific good or bad motivation, we are performing <a id="_idIndexMarker261"></a>neutral actions.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">All non-virtuous actions are contaminated because they are motivated by delusions, particularly the delusion of self-grasping ignorance. Most of our virtuous and neutral actions are also based on self-grasping and are thus also contaminated. At the moment, even when we are observing moral discipline, for example, we still grasp at an inherently existent I or self who is acting in a moral way, and so our practice of <a id="_idIndexMarker262"></a>moral discipline is a contaminated <a id="_idIndexMarker263"></a>virtuous action, which causes <a id="_idIndexMarker264"></a>higher rebirth in samsara.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We grasp at an <a id="_idIndexMarker265"></a>inherently existent I and mine all the time, day and night. This mind is the delusion of self-grasping ignorance. Whenever we are embarrassed, afraid, angry, indignant or puffed up with pride, we have a very strong sense of self or I. The I that we are grasping on these occasions is the inherently existent I. Even when we are relaxed and relatively peaceful we still grasp our I as inherently existent, though in a less pronounced way. This mind of <a id="_idIndexMarker266"></a>self-grasping is the basis of all our <a id="_idIndexMarker267"></a>delusions and the source of all our problems. To free ourself from delusions and the problems they cause, we need to understand that the inherently existent I we grasp so firmly and continuously does not exist at all. It never has existed and never will. It is merely the fabrication of our self-grasping ignorance.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">To fulfil the wishes of this I – the inherently existent I that we believe actually exists – we normally perform innumerable positive and negative actions. These actions are known as ‘throwing actions’, which means actions that are motivated by strong self-grasping and that are the main cause of samsaric rebirth. Contaminated virtuous actions throw us into higher samsaric rebirths as a human, demi-god or god, whereas non-virtuous actions throw us into <a id="_idIndexMarker268"></a>lower rebirths in the <a id="_idIndexMarker269"></a>animal, hungry ghost or hell realms. When we are about to die, if we develop a negative state of mind such as anger, this causes the<a id="_idIndexMarker270"></a> potential of a non-virtuous throwing action to ripen so that after death we will take a lower rebirth. Alternatively, if at the time of <a id="_idIndexMarker271"></a>death we develop a virtuous state of mind – for example by remembering our daily spiritual practice – this causes the potential of a virtuous throwing action to ripen, so that after death we will be reborn as a <a id="_idIndexMarker272"></a>human being or one of the other two types of <a id="_idIndexMarker273"></a>higher samsaric being, and will have to experience the sufferings of these beings.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">There is another type of contaminated action, which is called a ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker274"></a>completing action’. This is a contaminated action that is the main cause of the happiness or suffering we experience once we have taken a particular rebirth. All human beings are thrown into the human world by virtuous <a id="_idIndexMarker275"></a>throwing actions, but the experiences they have as human beings vary considerably depending upon their different completing actions. Some experience a life of suffering, whereas others experience a life of ease. Similarly, animals have all been thrown into the animal world by non-virtuous throwing actions, but their experiences as animals vary considerably depending upon their different completing actions. Some animals, such as some domestic pets, can experience a life of luxury, receiving more care and attention than many human beings. <a id="_idIndexMarker276"></a>Hell beings and <a id="_idIndexMarker277"></a>hungry ghosts experience only the results of non-virtuous throwing actions and non-virtuous completing actions. From the day they are born to the day they die, they experience nothing but suffering.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">One throwing action may throw us into many future lives. In Buddhist scriptures an example is given of a man who became very angry with an ordained monk and told him he looked like a frog. As a result, this unfortunate man was reborn many times as a frog. However, just one rebirth is sometimes sufficient to exhaust the power of our throwing action.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Some of our actions ripen in the same life in which they are performed, and these are necessarily completing actions; some ripen in the next life, some ripen in lives after that, and these can be either throwing or completing actions.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para _idGenParaOverride-1">In conclusion, we can see that first we develop strong self-grasping, from which arise all the other delusions. These delusions impel us to create throwing karma, which causes us to take another samsaric rebirth in which we experience fear, suffering and <a id="_idIndexMarker278"></a>problems. Throughout this rebirth we continuously develop self-grasping and other delusions, impelling us to create more throwing actions, and leading to yet further contaminated <a id="_idIndexMarker279"></a>rebirths. This process of <a id="_idIndexMarker280"></a>samsara is an endless cycle, unless we attain nirvana.</p>
