			<p id="_idParaDest-14" class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_00-Chapter-title---TOC-Level-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>Meaningful Objects</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">Any object that through our understanding of it gives us great meaning is a <a id="_idIndexMarker473"></a>meaningful object. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">To solve our human <a id="_idIndexMarker474"></a>problems and to enable us to find everlasting peace and happiness, we should first know what is the real nature of our <a id="_idIndexMarker475"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker476"></a>problems and what are their main causes. Our problems do not exist outside our mind. The real nature of our problems is our unpleasant feelings, which are part of our mind. When our car, for example, has a problem, we often say, ‘I have a problem’, but in reality it is not our problem but the car’s problem, which is an outer problem. Our problem is an inner problem. By differentiating between inner and outer problems in this way, we can understand that the real nature of our problems is our own feelings, which are part of our mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">All our problems – our unpleasant <a id="_idIndexMarker477"></a>feelings – come from our delusions of <a id="_idIndexMarker478"></a>attachment and <a id="_idIndexMarker479"></a>self-grasping ignorance; therefore these <a id="_idIndexMarker480"></a>delusions are the main causes of our problems. We have strong attachment to the fulfilment of our own wishes and for this aim we work very hard throughout our life, experiencing many difficulties and problems. When our wishes are not fulfilled we experience unhappiness and <a id="_idIndexMarker481"></a>depression, which often causes us to become <a id="_idIndexMarker482"></a>angry, creating more problems for both ourself and others. We can understand this clearly through our own experience. When we lose our friends, job, status, or reputation and so forth, we experience pain and many difficulties. This is because of our strong attachment to these things. If we had no such attachment, there would be no basis for experiencing suffering and problems at their loss.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Due to strong <a id="_idIndexMarker483"></a>attachment to our own views, we immediately experience the inner problem of unpleasant feelings when someone opposes them. This causes us to become angry, which leads to arguments and conflicts with others, and this in turn gives rise to further problems such as those arising from fighting and even war. Most political <a id="_idIndexMarker484"></a>problems experienced throughout the world are caused by people with strong attachment to their own views. Many problems are also caused by people’s <a id="_idIndexMarker485"></a>attachment to their religious views.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">In previous lives, because of our <a id="_idIndexMarker486"></a>attachment to fulfilling our own wishes we performed many different actions that harmed other living beings. As a result of these actions, we now experience many different problems and sufferings in our life.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If we look with wisdom in the mirror of our <a id="_idIndexMarker487"></a>mind, we can see how our attachment, anger, and especially our <a id="_idIndexMarker488"></a>self-grasping ignorance are the causes of all our problems and sufferings. We will definitely realize that unless we control these delusions there is no other method to solve our human problems. Pure spiritual teachings, or <a id="_idIndexMarker489"></a>Dharma, are the only method to control our <a id="_idIndexMarker490"></a>delusions of attachment, anger and self-grasping ignorance. If we sincerely put these teachings into practice, we will definitely solve our human problems and find the real meaning of our life.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">In general, everyone who has physical or mental <a id="_idIndexMarker491"></a>pain, even animals, understands their own suffering. But what we really need to understand is the sufferings of our countless future lives. Through understanding this, we will develop a strong wish to liberate ourself from them. This is important for everybody because, if we have the wish to liberate ourself from the sufferings of future lives, we will definitely use our present human life for the freedom and happiness of our countless future lives. There is no greater meaning than this.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">If we do not have this wish, we will waste our <a id="_idIndexMarker492"></a>precious human life only for the freedom and happiness of this one short life. This would be foolish because our intention and actions would be no different from the intention and actions of animals who are concerned with this life alone. The great Yogi <a id="_idIndexMarker493"></a>Milarepa once said to a hunter called <a id="_idIndexMarker494"></a>Gonpo Dorje:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">Your body is human but your mind is that of an animal.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---last">You, a human being, who possess an animal’s mind, please listen to my song.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Usually we believe that solving the problems and sufferings of our present life is most important, and we dedicate our whole life for this purpose. In reality, the duration of the problems and sufferings of this life is very short; if we die tomorrow they will end tomorrow. However, since the duration of the problems and sufferings of <a id="_idIndexMarker495"></a>future lives is endless, the freedom and happiness of our future lives is vastly more important than the freedom and happiness of this one short life. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We may have the sincere wish to avoid <a id="_idIndexMarker496"></a>suffering permanently, but we never think to abandon our delusions. However, without controlling and abandoning our <a id="_idIndexMarker497"></a>delusions, it is impossible to attain permanent liberation from <a id="_idIndexMarker498"></a>suffering and problems. This is because delusions, principally self-grasping ignorance, are the source of all our suffering and the main cause of all our problems. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">First we should recognize that the principal <a id="_idIndexMarker499"></a>delusion is our <a id="_idIndexMarker500"></a>self-grasping, which always abides at our heart destroying our inner peace. Its nature is a <a id="_idIndexMarker501"></a>wrong awareness that mistakenly believes ourself and others to be truly, or inherently, existent. This is an ignorant mind because in reality things do not exist inherently – they exist as mere imputations. Because the foolish mind of self-grasping believes or grasps at ‘I’, ‘mine’, and all other phenomena as truly existent, we develop attachment to those things we like and hatred for those we do not like. We then perform various actions that harm other living beings and, as a result, we experience various sufferings and problems throughout this life and in life after life; this is the fundamental reason why we experience so many problems. Because our sense of truly existent ‘I’ and ‘mine’ is so strong, our self-grasping also acts as the basis of all our daily problems.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Self-grasping can be likened to a <a id="_idIndexMarker502"></a>poisonous tree, other delusions to its branches, and all our sufferings to its fruits; it is the fundamental source of all other <a id="_idIndexMarker503"></a>delusions and all our suffering and problems. Understanding this, we should apply great effort to recognize, reduce, and finally abandon this ignorance completely.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We know that generally, from time to time, everybody experiences a temporary cessation of particular sufferings. For instance, those who are physically healthy are experiencing a temporary cessation of sickness. However, this is not enough because it is only temporary. Later they will have to experience the <a id="_idIndexMarker504"></a>suffering of sickness again and again, in this life and in countless future lives. Every living being without exception has to experience the cycle of the sufferings of sickness, ageing, death and rebirth, in life after life, endlessly. Following <a id="_idIndexMarker505"></a>Buddha’s example, we should develop strong <a id="_idIndexMarker506"></a>renunciation for this endless cycle of suffering. When Buddha was living in the palace with his family, he saw how his people were constantly experiencing these sufferings and he made the strong determination to attain enlightenment, the supreme permanent cessation of suffering, and to lead every living being to this state.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Buddha did not encourage us to abandon daily activities that provide necessary conditions for living, or that prevent poverty, environmental problems, particular diseases, and so forth. However, no matter how successful we are in these activities, we will never achieve permanent cessation of such problems. We will still have to experience them in our countless future lives and, even in this life, although we work very hard to prevent these problems, the sufferings of poverty, environmental pollution and disease are increasing throughout the world. Furthermore, because of the power of modern technology there are now many great dangers developing in the world that have never been experienced before. Therefore, we should not be satisfied with a merely temporary freedom from particular <a id="_idIndexMarker507"></a>sufferings, but apply great effort to attaining permanent freedom while we have this opportunity.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We should consider the preciousness of our <a id="_idIndexMarker508"></a>human life. Because of their previous deluded views that denied the value of spiritual practice, those who have taken rebirth as animals, for example, have no opportunity to engage in spiritual practice that alone gives rise to a meaningful life. Since it is impossible for them to listen to, understand, contemplate and meditate on spiritual instructions, their present animal rebirth itself is an obstacle. Only <a id="_idIndexMarker509"></a>human beings are free from such obstacles and have all the necessary conditions for engaging in <a id="_idIndexMarker510"></a>spiritual paths, which alone lead to everlasting peace and happiness. This combination of freedom and possession of necessary conditions is the special characteristic that makes our human life so precious. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Because self-grasping is the root of suffering, if we do not attain the permanent cessation of <a id="_idIndexMarker511"></a>self-grasping we will never attain the permanent cessation of suffering. How can we attain the permanent cessation of self-grasping? First we should know that there are nine different types of <a id="_idIndexMarker512"></a>self-grasping. These are: self-grasping of the <a id="_idIndexMarker513"></a>desire realm; self-grasping of the first, second, third and fourth <a id="_idIndexMarker514"></a>form realms; and self-grasping of the first, second, third and fourth <a id="_idIndexMarker515"></a>formless realms. The first is the most gross level of self-grasping, and they progressively become more and more subtle, so the ninth, called the ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker516"></a>self-grasping of the Peak of Samsara’ is the most subtle. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Through continually meditating on <a id="_idIndexMarker517"></a>emptiness with the motivation of <a id="_idIndexMarker518"></a>renunciation we will gradually abandon these nine types of self-grasping and finally, when we abandon the self-grasping of the Peak of Samsara, we will attain the permanent cessation of our <a id="_idIndexMarker519"></a>self-grasping and all other delusions. At the same time we will attain the permanent cessation of all the <a id="_idIndexMarker520"></a>sufferings of this life and countless future lives. This permanent cessation of suffering and its cause, self-grasping, is actual liberation and is known as ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker521"></a>nirvana’, the supreme permanent inner peace. Thus we will have accomplished the real meaning of human life.  </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Those who have attained liberation, or nirvana, always abide in a <a id="_idIndexMarker522"></a>Pure Land in which they experience a pure environment, pure enjoyments, pure bodies and pure minds. This is because their minds are completely pure, free from the stains of all delusions. They also benefit living beings through their <a id="_idIndexMarker523"></a>emanations. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Liberation cannot be attained without applying effort – just waiting and thinking that one day someone will bestow  upon us permanent <a id="_idIndexMarker524"></a>liberation from all problems. It is only through following the path to liberation that we will attain nirvana. The path to liberation is not an external path, but an inner path. We know that external paths lead from one place to another, whereas the path to <a id="_idIndexMarker525"></a>liberation is an inner path that leads from samsara to a <a id="_idIndexMarker526"></a>Pure Land. An inner <a id="_idIndexMarker527"></a>path is a mental action, and is either virtuous or non-virtuous; it cannot be a neutral action. Mental <a id="_idIndexMarker528"></a>actions that are non-virtuous lead us to any of the three lower rebirths: rebirth as an animal, hungry ghost or hell being. Mental actions that are contaminated virtue lead us to any of the three higher rebirths: rebirth as a human being, demi-god or god. Mental actions motivated by <a id="_idIndexMarker529"></a>renunciation lead us to the state of pure and everlasting happiness of liberation, nirvana. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Renunciation is the gateway through which we enter the path to liberation. The actual path to <a id="_idIndexMarker530"></a>liberation has five levels: the path of accumulation, the path of preparation, the path of seeing, the path of meditation and the Path of No More Learning. The practice of these five <a id="_idIndexMarker531"></a>paths are contained within the practice of <a id="_idIndexMarker532"></a>three higher trainings: training in moral discipline, training in concentration or meditation, and training in the wisdom realizing emptiness, all motivated by renunciation – the sincere wish to permanently liberate ourself from suffering and its cause, self-grasping.  We need to sincerely practise the three higher trainings because they are the main <a id="_idIndexMarker533"></a>path to liberation.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The nature of <a id="_idIndexMarker534"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker535"></a>moral discipline is abandoning inappropriate actions, maintaining pure behaviour, and performing every action correctly with a virtuous motivation. Moral discipline is most important for everybody in order to prevent future problems for oneself and for others. It makes us pure because it makes our actions pure. We ourself need to be clean and pure; just having a clean body is not enough, since our body is not our self. Moral discipline is like a <a id="_idIndexMarker536"></a>great earth that supports and nurtures the crops of spiritual realizations, Dharma realizations. Without practising moral discipline, it is very difficult to make progress in spiritual trainings. Training in higher moral discipline is learning to be deeply familiar with the practice of moral discipline, motivated by <a id="_idIndexMarker537"></a>renunciation.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The second higher training is training in higher concentration. The nature of <a id="_idIndexMarker538"></a>concentration is preventing distractions and concentrating on virtuous objects. It is very important to train in concentration, as with distractions we cannot accomplish anything. Training in higher concentration is learning to be deeply familiar with the ability to stop distractions and concentrate on virtuous objects, motivated by renunciation. With regard to any Dharma practice, if our concentration is clear and strong, it is very easy to make progress. Normally our main problem is <a id="_idIndexMarker539"></a>distractions. The practice of moral discipline prevents gross distractions, and concentration prevents subtle distractions; together they give rise to quick results in our Dharma practice.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The third higher training is training in higher <a id="_idIndexMarker540"></a>wisdom. The nature of wisdom is a virtuous <a id="_idIndexMarker541"></a>intelligent mind whose functions are to dispel confusion and to understand meaningful objects. Many people are very intelligent in destroying their enemies, caring for their families, finding what they want, and so forth, but this is not wisdom. Even <a id="_idIndexMarker542"></a>animals have such intelligence. Worldly intelligence is deceptive, whereas wisdom will never deceive us. It is our inner Spiritual Guide that leads us to correct paths, and is the <a id="_idIndexMarker543"></a>divine eye through which we can see past and future lives and the special connection between our actions and our experiences, known as ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker544"></a>karma’. The subject of karma is very extensive and subtle, and we can understand it only through wisdom. Training in higher wisdom is meditating on wisdom realizing emptiness, motivated by renunciation. Having realized <a id="_idIndexMarker545"></a>emptiness we transform our mind into the wisdom realizing emptiness and remain on it single-pointedly for as long as possible. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para _idGenParaOverride-1">The practice of the three higher trainings is the scientific method to attain the permanent cessation of <a id="_idIndexMarker546"></a>suffering and its cause, <a id="_idIndexMarker547"></a>self-grasping. This can be understood by the following analogy. When we cut a <a id="_idIndexMarker548"></a>tree using a saw, the saw alone cannot cut the tree without the use of our hands, which in turn depends upon our body. Training in higher moral discipline is like our body, training in higher concentration is like our hands, and training in higher wisdom is like the saw. By using these three together, we can cut the <a id="_idIndexMarker549"></a>poisonous tree of our self-grasping ignorance, and automatically all other delusions – its branches – and all our sufferings and problems – its fruits – will cease completely. Then we will have attained the permanent cessation of the sufferings of this life and countless future lives. We will have solved all our human problems and accomplished the real meaning of our <a id="_idIndexMarker550"></a>life.</p>
