			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">The way to deepen our love for others is to familiarize ourself with the practice of cherishing others. To strengthen our determination to cherish all living beings, we need to receive further instructions on enhancing cherishing love.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">We all have someone whom we regard as especially <a id="_idIndexMarker660"></a>precious, such as our child, our partner or our mother. This person seems to be imbued with unique qualities that make him or her stand out from others. We treasure and want to take special care of this person. We need to learn to regard all living beings in a similar way, recognizing each and every one as special and uniquely valuable. Although we already cherish our <a id="_idIndexMarker661"></a>family and close friends, we do not love <a id="_idIndexMarker662"></a>strangers, and we certainly do not love our <a id="_idIndexMarker663"></a>enemies. For us the vast majority of living beings are of no particular significance. By practising the instructions on <a id="_idIndexMarker664"></a>cherishing others, we can remove this bias and come to treasure each and every living being, just as a mother regards her dearest child. The more we can deepen and enhance our love in this way, the stronger our <a id="_idIndexMarker665"></a>compassion and <a id="_idIndexMarker666"></a>bodhichitta will become, and the quicker we will attain <a id="_idIndexMarker667"></a>enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">RECOGNIZING OUR FAULTS IN THE <a id="_idIndexMarker668"></a> MIRROR OF <a id="_idIndexMarker669"></a>DHARMA</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">One of the main functions of Buddha’s teachings, or Dharma, is to serve as a mirror in which we can see our own <a id="_idIndexMarker670"></a>faults. For example, when <a id="_idIndexMarker671"></a>anger arises in our mind, instead of making excuses we need to say to ourself, ‘This anger is the inner poison of delusion. It has no value or justification; its only function is to harm. I will not tolerate its presence in my mind.’ We can also use the mirror of Dharma to distinguish between desirous <a id="_idIndexMarker672"></a>attachment and <a id="_idIndexMarker673"></a>love. These two are easily confused, but it is vital to discriminate between them, for love will bring us only happiness whereas the mind of attachment will bring us only suffering and bind us ever more tightly to samsara. The moment we notice attachment arising in our mind, we should be on our guard – no matter how pleasant it may seem to follow our attachment, it is like licking honey off a razor’s edge and in the long run invariably leads to more suffering.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The main reason why we do not cherish all living beings is that we are so preoccupied with ourself, and this leaves very little room in our mind to appreciate others. If we wish to cherish others sincerely, we have to reduce our obsessive self-concern. Why is it that we regard ourself as so <a id="_idIndexMarker674"></a>precious, but not others? It is because we are so <a id="_idIndexMarker675"></a>familiar with <a id="_idIndexMarker676"></a>self-cherishing. Since <a id="_idIndexMarker677"></a>beginningless time we have grasped at a truly existent I. This <a id="_idIndexMarker678"></a>grasping at I automatically gives rise to self-cherishing, which instinctively feels, ‘I am more important than others.’ For <a id="_idIndexMarker679"></a>ordinary beings, <a id="_idIndexMarker680"></a>grasping at one’s own I and self-cherishing are like two sides of the same coin: I-grasping grasps at a truly existent I, whereas <a id="_idIndexMarker681"></a>self-cherishing feels this I to be precious and cherishes it. The fundamental reason for this is our constant familiarity with our self-cherishing, day and night, even during our sleep.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Since we regard our self or I as so very precious and important, we exaggerate our own good qualities and develop an inflated view of ourself. Almost anything can serve as a basis for this arrogant mind, such as our looks, possessions, knowledge, experiences or status. If we make a witty remark we think, ‘I’m so clever!’, or if we have travelled round the world we feel that this automatically makes us a fascinating person. We can even develop <a id="_idIndexMarker682"></a>pride on the basis of things we ought to be ashamed of, such as our ability to deceive others, or on <a id="_idIndexMarker683"></a>qualities that we merely imagine we possess. On the other hand, we find it very hard to accept our mistakes and shortcomings. We spend so much time contemplating our real or imagined good qualities that we become oblivious to our faults. In reality our mind is full of gross delusions but we ignore them and may even fool ourself into thinking that we do not have such repulsive minds. This is like pretending that there is no dirt in our house after sweeping it under the carpet.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">It is often so painful to admit that we have faults that we make all manner of excuses rather than alter our exalted view of ourself. One of the most common ways of not facing up to our faults is to <a id="_idIndexMarker684"></a>blame others. For instance, if we have a difficult <a id="_idIndexMarker685"></a>relationship with someone, we naturally conclude that it is entirely their <a id="_idIndexMarker686"></a>fault – we are unable to accept that it is at least partly ours. Instead of taking responsibility for our actions and making an effort to change our behaviour, we argue with them and insist that it is they who must change. An exaggerated sense of our own importance thus leads to a critical attitude towards other people and makes it almost impossible to avoid conflict. The fact that we are oblivious to our faults does not prevent other people from noticing them and pointing them out, but when they do we feel that they are being unfair. Instead of looking honestly at our own behaviour to see whether or not the criticism is justified, our self-cherishing mind becomes defensive and retaliates by finding faults with them.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Another reason why we do not regard others as <a id="_idIndexMarker687"></a>precious is that we pay attention to their faults while ignoring their good <a id="_idIndexMarker688"></a>qualities. Unfortunately we have become very skilled in recognizing the faults of others, and we devote a great deal of mental energy to listing them, analyzing them and even meditating on them! With this critical attitude, if we disagree with our partner or colleagues about something, instead of trying to understand their point of view we repeatedly think of many reasons why we are right and they are wrong. By focusing exclusively on their faults and limitations, we become <a id="_idIndexMarker689"></a>angry and resentful and, rather than cherishing them, we develop the wish to harm or discredit them. In this way, small disagreements can easily turn into conflicts that simmer for months.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">Nothing good ever comes from dwelling on our own qualities and others’ <a id="_idIndexMarker690"></a>faults. All that happens is that we develop a highly distorted, self-important view of ourself, and an arrogant, disrespectful attitude towards others. As the great scholar <a id="_idIndexMarker691"></a>Shantideva says in <a id="_idIndexMarker692"></a><span class="_1---Italic">Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</span>:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">If we hold ourself in high esteem, we shall be reborn in the lower realms</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---last">And later, as a human, experience low status and a foolish mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">As a result of regarding ourself as superior and others as inferior, we perform many <a id="_idIndexMarker693"></a>negative actions that will later ripen as rebirth in the lower realms. Due to this haughty attitude, even when we finally take <a id="_idIndexMarker694"></a>rebirth again as a human being we will be of a low social status, living like a servant or slave. Out of <a id="_idIndexMarker695"></a>pride we may regard ourself as highly intelligent, but in reality our pride makes us foolish and fills our mind with negativity. There is no value in viewing ourself as more important than others and thinking only of our own <a id="_idIndexMarker696"></a>qualities. It neither increases our qualities nor reduces our faults, and it does not cause others to share our exalted opinion of ourself.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If instead we focus on the good <a id="_idIndexMarker697"></a>qualities of others, our deluded <a id="_idIndexMarker698"></a>pride will decrease and we will come to regard them as more important and precious than ourself. As a result, our <a id="_idIndexMarker699"></a>love and <a id="_idIndexMarker700"></a>compassion will increase and we will naturally engage in virtuous actions. Due to this we will be reborn in the <a id="_idIndexMarker701"></a>higher realms, as a <a id="_idIndexMarker702"></a>human or god, and we will gain the respect and friendship of many people. Only good can come from contemplating the good qualities of others. Therefore, whereas ordinary beings look for faults in others, <a id="_idIndexMarker703"></a>Bodhisattvas look solely for good qualities.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">In <a id="_idIndexMarker704"></a><span class="_1---Italic">Advice from Atisha’s Heart</span> it says:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---prose---single">Do not look for faults in others, but look for faults in yourself, and purge them like bad blood.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---prose---single">Do not contemplate your own good qualities, but contemplate the good qualities of others, and respect everyone as a servant would.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">We need to think about our own faults because if we are not aware of them we will not be motivated to overcome them. It was through constantly examining their minds for faults and imperfections, and then applying great effort to abandon them, that those who are now enlightened were able to release their minds from delusions, the source of all faults. <a id="_idIndexMarker705"></a>Buddha said that those who understand their own faults are wise, whereas those who are unaware of their own faults yet look for faults in others are fools. Contemplating our own qualities and others’ faults serves only to increase our self-cherishing and diminish our love for others; yet all enlightened beings agree that <a id="_idIndexMarker706"></a>self-cherishing is the root of all faults and <a id="_idIndexMarker707"></a>cherishing others is the source of all happiness. The only people who disagree with this view are those who are still in samsara. We can keep our ordinary <a id="_idIndexMarker708"></a>view if we wish, or we can adopt the view of all the holy beings. The choice is ours, but we would be wise to adopt the latter if we wish to enjoy real peace and happiness.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Some people argue that one of our main problems is a lack of self-esteem, and that we need to focus exclusively on our good qualities in order to boost our <a id="_idIndexMarker709"></a>self-confidence. It is true that to make authentic spiritual progress we need to develop confidence in our spiritual potential, and to acknowledge and improve our good qualities. However, we also need a keen and realistic awareness of our present faults and imperfections. If we are honest with ourself, we will recognize that at the moment our mind is filled with defilements such as anger, attachment and ignorance. These mental diseases will not go away just by our pretending they do not exist. The only way we can ever get rid of them is by honestly acknowledging their existence and then making the effort to eliminate them.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Although we need to be acutely aware of our faults we must never allow ourself to become overwhelmed or discouraged by them. We may have a lot of anger in our mind but this does not mean that we are an inherently angry person. No matter how many <a id="_idIndexMarker710"></a>delusions we may have or how strong they are, they are not an essential part of our mind. They are defilements that temporarily pollute our mind but do not sully its pure, essential nature. They are like mud that dirties water but never becomes an intrinsic part of it. Just as <a id="_idIndexMarker711"></a>mud can always be removed to reveal pure, clear water, so delusions can be removed to reveal the natural <a id="_idIndexMarker712"></a>purity and clarity of our <a id="_idIndexMarker713"></a>mind. While acknowledging that we have delusions, we should not identify with them, thinking ‘I am a selfish, worthless person’ or ‘I am an angry person.’ Instead, we should identify with our pure <a id="_idIndexMarker714"></a>potential and develop the wisdom and courage to overcome our delusions.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">When we look at external things, we can usually distinguish those that are useful and valuable from those that are not. We must learn to look at our mind in the same way. Although the nature of our root <a id="_idIndexMarker715"></a>mind is pure and clear, many <a id="_idIndexMarker716"></a>conceptual thoughts arise from it, like bubbles arising within an ocean or rays of light arising from a single flame. Some of these thoughts are beneficial and lead to happiness both now and in the future, whereas others lead to suffering and the extreme misery of rebirth in the lower realms. We need to keep a constant watch over our mind and learn to distinguish between the beneficial and harmful thoughts that are arising moment by moment. Those who are able to do this are truly wise.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Once an evil man who had killed thousands of people met a Bodhisattva called <a id="_idIndexMarker717"></a>King Chandra, who helped him by teaching him Dharma and showing him the error of his ways. The man said, ‘Having looked into the mirror of <a id="_idIndexMarker718"></a>Dharma I now understand how negative my actions have been, and I feel great regret for them.’ Motivated by deep remorse, he engaged sincerely in purification practices and eventually became a highly realized <a id="_idIndexMarker719"></a>Yogi. This shows that by recognizing one’s own faults in the mirror of Dharma and then making a concerted effort to remove them, even the most evil person can become a completely pure being.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">In Tibet there was once a famous Dharma practitioner called Geshe Ben Gungyal, who neither recited prayers nor meditated in the traditional meditation posture. His sole practice was to observe his mind very attentively and counter delusions as soon as they arose. Whenever he noticed his mind becoming even slightly agitated, he was especially vigilant and refused to follow any negative thoughts. For instance, if he felt self-cherishing was about to arise, he would immediately recall its disadvantages and then he would stop this mind from manifesting by applying its <a id="_idIndexMarker720"></a>opponent, the practice of love. Whenever his mind was naturally peaceful and positive, he would relax and allow himself to enjoy his virtuous states of mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">To gauge his progress he would put a black pebble down in front of him whenever a negative thought arose, and a white pebble whenever a positive thought arose, and at the end of the day he would count the pebbles. If there were more black pebbles he would reprimand himself and try even harder the next day, but if there were more white pebbles he would praise and encourage himself. At the beginning, the black pebbles greatly outnumbered the white ones, but over the years his mind improved until he reached the point when entire days went by without any black pebbles. Before becoming a Dharma practitioner, Geshe <a id="_idIndexMarker721"></a>Ben Gungyal had had a reputation for being wild and unruly but, by watching his mind closely all the time, and judging it with complete honesty in the mirror of <a id="_idIndexMarker722"></a>Dharma, he gradually became a very pure and holy being. Why can we not do the same?</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The <a id="_idIndexMarker723"></a>Kadampa Masters, or <a id="_idIndexMarker724"></a>Geshes, taught that the function of a Spiritual Guide is to point out his or her disciples’ faults, for then the disciples have a clear understanding of these shortcomings and the opportunity to overcome them. These days, however, if a Teacher were to point out his or her disciples’ faults they would probably become upset, and might even lose their faith, and so the Teacher usually has to adopt a gentler approach. However, even though our <a id="_idIndexMarker725"></a>Spiritual Guide may tactfully be refraining from directly pointing out our faults, we still need to become aware of them by examining our mind in the mirror of his or her teachings. By relating our Spiritual Guide’s teachings on <a id="_idIndexMarker726"></a>karma and delusions to our own situation, we will be able to understand what we need to abandon and what we need to practise.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">A sick person cannot be cured of his illness just by reading the instructions on a bottle of medicine, but he can be cured by actually taking the medicine. Similarly, Buddha gave Dharma <a id="_idIndexMarker727"></a>instructions as supreme medicine to cure the inner disease of our delusions, but we cannot cure this disease just by reading or studying <a id="_idIndexMarker728"></a>Dharma books. We can only solve our daily <a id="_idIndexMarker729"></a>problems by taking Dharma into our heart and practising it sincerely.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">VIEWING ALL LIVING BEINGS AS SUPREME</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para---space-below">The great Bodhisattva <a id="_idIndexMarker730"></a>Langri Tangpa made the prayer:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">With a pure intention,</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---last">May I cherish others as supreme.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">If we wish to attain <a id="_idIndexMarker731"></a>enlightenment, or to develop the superior <a id="_idIndexMarker732"></a>bodhichitta that comes from exchanging self with others, we must definitely adopt the view that others are more precious than ourself. This view is based on wisdom and leads us to our final goal, whereas the view that regards ourself as more precious than others is based on self-grasping ignorance and leads us to <a id="_idIndexMarker733"></a>lower rebirth.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">What exactly does it mean to say that something is <a id="_idIndexMarker734"></a>precious? If we were asked which was more precious, a diamond or a bone, we would say a diamond. This is because a diamond is more useful to us. However, for a dog a bone would be more precious because he can eat a bone whereas he cannot do anything with a diamond. This indicates that preciousness is not an intrinsic quality of an object but depends upon an individual’s needs and wishes, which in turn depend upon his or her <a id="_idIndexMarker735"></a>karma. For someone whose main wish is to achieve the spiritual realizations of love, <a id="_idIndexMarker736"></a>compassion, <a id="_idIndexMarker737"></a>bodhichitta and great enlightenment, living beings are more precious than a universe filled with diamonds or even <a id="_idIndexMarker738"></a>wish-granting jewels. Why is this? It is because living beings help that person to develop <a id="_idIndexMarker739"></a>love and compassion and to fulfil their wish for enlightenment, which is something that a whole universe filled with jewels could never do.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">No one wants to remain an <a id="_idIndexMarker740"></a>ordinary, ignorant being forever; indeed, all of us have the wish to improve ourself and to progress to higher and higher states. The highest state of all is full enlightenment, and the main road leading to enlightenment is the realizations of love, compassion, bodhichitta and the practice of the <a id="_idIndexMarker741"></a>six perfections – the perfections of <a id="_idIndexMarker742"></a>giving, <a id="_idIndexMarker743"></a>moral discipline, <a id="_idIndexMarker744"></a>patience, <a id="_idIndexMarker745"></a>effort, <a id="_idIndexMarker746"></a>concentration and <a id="_idIndexMarker747"></a>wisdom. We can only develop these qualities in dependence upon other living beings. How can we learn to love with no one to love? How can we practise giving with no one to give to, or patience with no one to irritate us? Whenever we see another living being we can increase our spiritual qualities such as love and compassion, and in this way we come closer to enlightenment and the fulfilment of our deepest wishes. How <a id="_idIndexMarker748"></a>kind living beings are to act as the objects of our love and compassion. How <a id="_idIndexMarker749"></a>precious they are!</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">When <a id="_idIndexMarker750"></a>Atisha was in Tibet he had an Indian assistant who was always criticizing him. When the Tibetans asked him why he kept this assistant when there were many faithful Tibetans who would be more than happy to serve him, Atisha replied, ‘Without this man, there would be no one with whom I could practise patience. He is very kind to me. I need him!’ Atisha understood that the only way to fulfil his deepest wish to benefit all living beings was to achieve enlightenment, and that to do this he needed to perfect his patience. For Atisha, his bad-tempered assistant was more precious than material possessions, praise or any other worldly attainment.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Our spiritual <a id="_idIndexMarker751"></a>realizations are our inner <a id="_idIndexMarker752"></a>wealth for they help us in all situations and are the only possessions we can take with us when we die. Once we learn to value the inner wealth of patience, giving, love and compassion above external conditions, we will come to regard each and every living being as supremely precious, no matter how they treat us. This will make it very easy for us to cherish them.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">In our meditation session, we contemplate the reasons given above until we reach the following conclusion:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---meditation---single">Sentient beings are extremely precious because without them I cannot gather the inner wealth of spiritual realizations that will eventually bring me the ultimate happiness of full enlightenment. Since without this inner wealth I will have to remain in samsara forever, I will always regard sentient beings as supremely important.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">We meditate on this determination single-pointedly for as long as possible. When we rise from meditation we try to maintain this determination all the time, recognizing how much we need each and every sentient being for our spiritual practice. By maintaining this recognition, our problems of <a id="_idIndexMarker753"></a>anger, <a id="_idIndexMarker754"></a>attachment, <a id="_idIndexMarker755"></a>jealousy and so forth will subside, and we will naturally come to cherish others. In particular, whenever people interfere with our wishes or <a id="_idIndexMarker756"></a>criticize us, we should remember that we need these people in order to develop the spiritual <a id="_idIndexMarker757"></a>realizations that are the true meaning of our <a id="_idIndexMarker758"></a>human life. If everyone treated us with the kindness and respect our self-cherishing feels we deserve, this would only reinforce our delusions and deplete our merit. Imagine what we would be like if we always got what we wanted! We would be just like a spoilt child who feels that the world revolves around him, and who is unpopular with everyone. In fact, we all need someone like <a id="_idIndexMarker759"></a>Atisha’s assistant, for such people give us the opportunity to destroy our <a id="_idIndexMarker760"></a>self-cherishing and train our mind, thereby making our life truly meaningful.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">Since the above reasoning is the exact opposite to our normal way of thinking, we need to contemplate it very carefully until we are convinced that each and every sentient being is indeed more <a id="_idIndexMarker761"></a>precious than any external attainment. In reality <a id="_idIndexMarker762"></a>Buddhas and sentient beings are equally <a id="_idIndexMarker763"></a>precious – Buddhas because they reveal the path to enlightenment, and sentient beings because they act as the objects of the compassion that we need in order to attain enlightenment. Because their <a id="_idIndexMarker764"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker765"></a>kindness in enabling us to attain our supreme goal, enlightenment, is equal, we should regard Buddhas and sentient beings as equally important and precious. As Shantideva says in <a id="_idIndexMarker766"></a><span class="_1---Italic">Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</span>:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">Since living beings and enlightened beings are alike</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">In that the qualities of a Buddha arise in dependence upon them,</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">Why do we not show the same respect to living beings</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---last-full-space-below">As we do to the enlightened beings?</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">LIVING BEINGS HAVE NO FAULTS</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">We might object that while it is true that we depend upon sentient beings as the objects of our patience, compassion and so forth, it is nevertheless impossible to see them as precious when they have so many <a id="_idIndexMarker767"></a>faults. How can we regard as precious someone whose mind is pervaded by attachment, anger and ignorance? The answer to this objection is quite profound. Although sentient beings’ minds are filled with <a id="_idIndexMarker768"></a>delusions, sentient beings themselves are not faulty. We say that sea water is salty. However, the real nature of water is not salty because salt can be removed from it. Similarly, all the faults we see in people are actually the faults of their delusions, not of the people themselves. <a id="_idIndexMarker769"></a>Buddhas see that delusions have many faults but they never see people as faulty, because they distinguish between people and their delusions. If someone is angry we think, ‘He is a bad and angry person’, whereas Buddhas think, ‘He is a suffering being afflicted with the inner disease of <a id="_idIndexMarker770"></a>anger.’ If a friend of ours were suffering from <a id="_idIndexMarker771"></a>cancer we would not blame him for his physical disease, and, in the same way, if someone is suffering from anger or attachment we should not blame him for the diseases of his mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Delusions are the <a id="_idIndexMarker772"></a>enemies of sentient beings, and just as we would not blame a victim for the faults of his attacker, why should we blame sentient beings for the faults of their enemies? When someone is temporarily overpowered by the enemy of anger it is inappropriate to blame him, because in reality he is a victim. Just as a fault of a microphone is not that of a book, and a fault of a cup is not that of a teapot, so the faults of delusions are not those of a person. The only appropriate response to those who are driven by their delusions to harm others is <a id="_idIndexMarker773"></a>compassion. Sometimes it is necessary to force those who are behaving in very deluded ways to stop, both for their own sake and to protect other people, but it is never appropriate to blame or become angry with them.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We normally refer to our body and <a id="_idIndexMarker774"></a>mind as ‘my body’ and ‘my mind’, in the same way as we refer to our other possessions. This indicates that they are different from our <a id="_idIndexMarker775"></a>I. The <a id="_idIndexMarker776"></a>body and mind are the <a id="_idIndexMarker777"></a>basis upon which we establish our I, not the I itself. Delusions are characteristics of a person’s mind, not of the person. Since we can never find faults in sentient beings themselves, we can say that in this respect sentient beings are like Buddhas.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">From this point of view sentient beings are like <a id="_idIndexMarker778"></a>enlightened beings. Their root mind, their own mind, is completely pure. Their own mind is like a <a id="_idIndexMarker779"></a>blue sky and their delusions and all other conceptions are like clouds that temporarily arise. From another point of view sentient beings mistakenly identify themselves and are harmed by delusions. They endlessly experience immense <a id="_idIndexMarker780"></a>suffering as <a id="_idIndexMarker781"></a>hallucinations. Therefore we need to develop <a id="_idIndexMarker782"></a>compassion for them, and liberate them from their deep hallucination of <a id="_idIndexMarker783"></a>mistaken appearance by showing them the real nature of things, which is the <a id="_idIndexMarker784"></a>emptiness of all phenomena.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Just as we distinguish between a person and his or her delusions, so we should also remember that the <a id="_idIndexMarker785"></a>delusions are only temporary, adventitious characteristics of that person’s mind and not its real nature. Delusions are distorted <a id="_idIndexMarker786"></a>conceptual thoughts that arise within the mind, like waves on the ocean – just as it is possible for waves to die down without the ocean disappearing, so it is possible for our delusions to end without our <a id="_idIndexMarker787"></a>mental continuum ceasing.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">It is because they distinguish between delusions and persons that <a id="_idIndexMarker788"></a>Buddhas are able to see the faults of delusions without ever seeing a single fault in any sentient being. Consequently, their <a id="_idIndexMarker789"></a>love and <a id="_idIndexMarker790"></a>compassion for sentient beings never diminish. Failing to make this distinction, we, on the other hand, are constantly finding fault with other people but do not recognize the <a id="_idIndexMarker791"></a>faults of delusions, even those within our own mind. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">There is a prayer that says:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">This fault I see is not the fault of the person</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">But the fault of delusion, or his actions.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">Realizing this, may I never view others’ faults,</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---last">But see all beings as supreme.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Focusing on other people’s faults is the source of much of our negativity and one of the main obstacles to viewing others as supremely precious. If we are genuinely interested in developing <a id="_idIndexMarker792"></a>cherishing love, we need to learn to discriminate between a person and his or her delusions, and realize that it is the delusions that are to blame for all the faults we perceive.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">There may appear to be a contradiction between this and the earlier section where we are advised to recognize our own faults. Surely if we have faults, so too do other people! But there is no contradiction. For the effectiveness of our purification practice we need to recognize our own faults, which are our delusions and our <a id="_idIndexMarker793"></a>non-virtuous actions. This also applies to others. And for the effectiveness of the practice of loving kindness towards all living beings, we need to understand that the faults that we see in the actions of living beings are not the faults of living beings, but the faults of their enemy – their delusions. We should practically appreciate these teachings; we do not need meaningless debate. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">When a <a id="_idIndexMarker794"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker795"></a>mother sees her child throwing a tantrum, she knows that the child is acting in a deluded way, but this does not diminish her love for him or her. Although she is not blind to the anger in her child, this does not lead her to the conclusion that the child is evil or intrinsically angry. Distinguishing between the delusion and the person, she continues to see her child as beautiful and full of potential. In the same way, we should regard all sentient beings as supremely precious, while clearly understanding that they are afflicted by the sickness of delusion.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We can also apply the above reasoning to ourself, recognizing that our faults are really the faults of our delusions and not of our self. This prevents us from identifying with our faults and thus feeling <a id="_idIndexMarker796"></a>guilty and inadequate, and it helps us to view our delusions in a realistic and practical way. We need to acknowledge our <a id="_idIndexMarker797"></a>delusions and take responsibility for overcoming them, but to do this effectively we need to distance ourself from them. For example, we can think, ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker798"></a>Self-cherishing is presently in my mind, but it is not myself. I can destroy it without destroying myself.’ In this way, we can be utterly ruthless with our delusions but kind and <a id="_idIndexMarker799"></a>patient with ourself. We do not need to <a id="_idIndexMarker800"></a>blame ourself for the many delusions we have inherited from our previous life, but, if we wish for our future self to enjoy peace and happiness, it is our responsibility to remove these delusions from our mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">As mentioned before, one of the best ways to regard others as precious is to remember their <a id="_idIndexMarker801"></a>kindness. Once again we may object, ‘How can I see others as kind when they engage in so many cruel and harmful actions?’ To answer this we need to understand that when people harm others they are controlled by their delusions. Delusions are like a powerful hallucinogenic drug that forces people to act in ways that are contrary to their real nature. A person under the influence of delusions is not in his right mind, because he is creating terrible suffering for himself and no one in his right mind would create suffering for himself. All delusions are based on a mistaken way of seeing things. When we see things as they really are, our delusions naturally disappear and virtuous minds naturally manifest. Minds such as love and kindness are based on reality and are an expression of our pure nature. Thus, when we view others as kind, we are seeing beyond their delusions and are relating to their pure nature, their Buddha nature.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para"><a id="_idIndexMarker802"></a>Buddha compared our <a id="_idIndexMarker803"></a>Buddha nature to a gold nugget in dirt, for, no matter how disgusting a person’s delusions may be, the real nature of their mind remains undefiled, like pure gold. In the heart of even the cruellest and most degenerate person exists the <a id="_idIndexMarker804"></a>potential for limitless love, compassion and wisdom. Unlike the seeds of our delusions, which can be destroyed, this potential is utterly indestructible and is the pure, essential nature of every living being. Whenever we meet other people, rather than focusing on their delusions we should focus on the gold of their Buddha nature. This will not only enable us to regard them as special and unique, but also help to bring out their good qualities. Recognizing everyone as a future Buddha, out of <a id="_idIndexMarker805"></a>love and compassion we will naturally help and encourage this potential to ripen.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Because we are so <a id="_idIndexMarker806"></a>familiar with cherishing ourself more than others, the view that all sentient beings are supremely important does not arise easily and we need to train our mind patiently for many years before it becomes natural. Just as an ocean is formed by many tiny drops of water gathering over a long period of time, so the realizations of love and compassion of advanced practitioners are the result of constant training. We should begin by trying to cherish our parents, family and close friends, and then extend this feeling to the people in our community. Gradually we can increase the scope of our cherishing until it includes all sentient beings.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">It is important to begin with our immediate circle because if we try to love all sentient beings in a general way, while neglecting to cherish the specific individuals with whom we associate, our cherishing will be abstract and inauthentic. We may develop some good feelings in meditation, but these will quickly disappear once we rise from meditation, and our mind will remain basically unchanged. However, if at the end of each <a id="_idIndexMarker807"></a>meditation session we make a special determination to cherish those with whom we are going to spend our time, and then put this determination into practice, our cherishing will be grounded and sincere. Through making a concerted effort to love our immediate circle, even when they are making life difficult for us, our <a id="_idIndexMarker808"></a>self-cherishing will be continuously eroded and we will gradually build in our mind a firm foundation of cherishing others. With this foundation it will not be difficult to extend our love to more and more sentient beings until we develop the universal love and compassion of a Bodhisattva.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Our ability to help others also depends upon our karmic connection with them from this and previous lives. We all have a close circle of people with whom we have a special <a id="_idIndexMarker809"></a>karmic connection in this life. Though we need to learn to cherish all living beings equally, this does not mean that we have to treat everyone in exactly the same way. For example, it would be inappropriate to treat people who do not like us in the same way as we treat our close friends and family; this is because they may not accept this. There are also people who just want to be left alone or who dislike any display of affection. <a id="_idIndexMarker810"></a>Loving others is principally an attitude of mind, and the way in which we express it depends upon the needs, wishes and situations of each individual, as well as our karmic connection with them. We cannot physically care for everyone, but we can develop a caring attitude towards all beings. This is the main point of <a id="_idIndexMarker811"></a>training the mind. By training our mind in this way we will eventually become a Buddha with the actual power to protect all sentient beings.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">Through carefully contemplating all the above points, we arrive at the following conclusion:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---meditation---single">Because all sentient beings are very precious to me, I must cherish them and hold them dear.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para---full-space-below">We should regard this determination as a seed and hold it continuously in our mind, nurturing it until it grows into the spontaneous feeling of cherishing ourself and all sentient beings equally. This realization is called ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker812"></a>equalizing self and others’. Just as we value our own peace and happiness, so too should we value the peace and happiness of all living beings; and just as we work to free ourself from suffering and problems, so too should we work to free others.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">DEVELOPING HUMILITY</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para---space-below">Bodhisattva Langri Tangpa said:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">Whenever I associate with others,</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---last">May I view myself as the lowest of all.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">With these words, <a id="_idIndexMarker813"></a>Langri Tangpa is encouraging us to develop the mind of <a id="_idIndexMarker814"></a>humility and to see ourself as lower and less <a id="_idIndexMarker815"></a>precious than others. As mentioned before, preciousness is not an inherent quality of an object but depends upon an individual’s karma. It is due to a <a id="_idIndexMarker816"></a>mother’s special karmic connection with her children that they naturally appear precious to her. For a practitioner who is seeking enlightenment, all sentient beings are equally precious, both because they are immensely kind and because they act as supreme objects for developing and increasing his or her spiritual <a id="_idIndexMarker817"></a>realizations. For such a practitioner, no single being is inferior or less important, not even an insect. We may wonder: if preciousness depends upon karma, is it because a practitioner seeking enlightenment has a karmic connection with all beings that he sees them as <a id="_idIndexMarker818"></a>precious? The practitioner develops this special view through contemplating correct reasons that cause to ripen his karmic potential to see all beings as his precious mother. In reality all sentient beings are our mothers, so of course we have a karmic connection with them; but due to our ignorance we have no idea that they are our precious mothers.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">In general, we would all prefer to enjoy high status and a good reputation, and we have little or no interest in being humble. Practitioners like <a id="_idIndexMarker819"></a>Langri Tangpa are the complete opposite. They actually seek out subordinate positions and wish for others to enjoy the happiness of higher status. There are three reasons why such practitioners strive to practise humility. Firstly, by practising humility we are not using up our merit on <a id="_idIndexMarker820"></a>worldly attainments but saving it for the development of internal <a id="_idIndexMarker821"></a>realizations. We only have a limited supply of <a id="_idIndexMarker822"></a>merit, so if we waste it on material possessions, <a id="_idIndexMarker823"></a>reputation, popularity or power there will not be enough positive energy left in our mind to effect deep spiritual realizations. Secondly, by practising humility and wishing for others to enjoy higher status, we accumulate a vast amount of merit. We should understand that now is the time to accumulate <a id="_idIndexMarker824"></a>merit, not to waste it for worldly enjoyments. Thirdly, we need to practise humility because there is no self or <a id="_idIndexMarker825"></a>I that we normally see. We should view our self or I – the object of our <a id="_idIndexMarker826"></a>self-cherishing – as the lowest of all, as something we need to neglect or forget. In this way our self-cherishing will become weaker and our love for others will increase.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Although many practitioners practise humility, they will nonetheless accept whatever social position enables them to benefit the most sentient beings. Such a practitioner may become a wealthy, powerful and respected member of society, but his or her motivation for doing so would be solely for the benefit of others. Worldly attainments do not attract him in the least, for he recognizes them as deceptive and a waste of his merit. Even if he were to become a king he would consider all his <a id="_idIndexMarker827"></a>wealth as belonging to others, and in his heart would continue to view others as supreme. Because he would not grasp at his position or <a id="_idIndexMarker828"></a>possessions as his own, they would not serve to exhaust his merit.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We need to practise humility even when we associate with those who according to social conventions are equal or inferior to us. Because we cannot see others’ minds, we do not know who is actually a <a id="_idIndexMarker829"></a>realized being and who is not. Someone may not have a high position in society, but if in his heart he maintains <a id="_idIndexMarker830"></a>loving kindness towards all living beings, in reality he is a realized being. Moreover, <a id="_idIndexMarker831"></a>Buddhas are able to manifest in any form to help living beings, and unless we are a Buddha ourself we have no means of knowing who is an emanation of a Buddha and who is not. We cannot say for sure that our closest <a id="_idIndexMarker832"></a>friend or worst <a id="_idIndexMarker833"></a>enemy, our <a id="_idIndexMarker834"></a>mother or even our <a id="_idIndexMarker835"></a>dog, is not an <a id="_idIndexMarker836"></a>emanation. The fact that we feel we know someone very well and have seen him or her behaving in deluded ways does not mean that he or she is an<a id="_idIndexMarker837"></a> ordinary person. What we see is a reflection of our own mind. An ordinary, deluded mind will naturally perceive a world filled with ordinary, deluded people.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Only when we <a id="_idIndexMarker838"></a>purify our <a id="_idIndexMarker839"></a>mind will we be able to see pure, <a id="_idIndexMarker840"></a>holy beings directly. Until then we cannot know for sure whether or not someone is an emanation. Perhaps everyone we know is an emanation of a Buddha! This may seem rather improbable, but only because we are so used to seeing people as ordinary. We simply do not know. All we can realistically say is that maybe someone is an emanation, maybe he or she is not. This is a very useful way of thinking, for if we think that someone may be an emanation of a Buddha we will naturally respect him and avoid harming him. From the point of view of the effect it has on our mind, thinking that someone may be a Buddha is almost the same as thinking that he or she is a Buddha. Since the only person we know for sure is not a Buddha is ourself, through training in this way of thinking we will gradually come to regard everyone else as superior to, and more precious than, ourself.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Viewing ourself as the lowest of all is not easy to accept at first. When we meet a dog, for example, are we supposed to view ourself as lower than the <a id="_idIndexMarker841"></a>dog?  We can consider the story of the Buddhist Master <a id="_idIndexMarker842"></a>Asanga, who came across a dying dog that in reality turned out to be an emanation of Buddha <a id="_idIndexMarker843"></a>Maitreya. The dog before us may appear to be an ordinary animal, but the fact is that we do not know its real nature. Perhaps it too has been emanated by Buddha to help us develop compassion. Since we cannot know for sure one way or another, rather than wasting our time speculating whether the dog is an ordinary animal or an emanation, we should simply think, ‘This dog may be an emanation of Buddha.’ From this point of view we can think that we are lower than the dog, and this thought will protect us against any feelings of superiority.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para _idGenParaOverride-1">One of the advantages of humility is that it enables us to learn from everyone. A proud person cannot learn from other people because he feels he already knows better than they. On the other hand, a humble person who respects everyone and recognizes that they may even be emanations of Buddha has the openness of mind to learn from everyone and every situation. Just as water cannot collect on mountain peaks, so good qualities and <a id="_idIndexMarker844"></a>blessings cannot gather on the rocky peaks of <a id="_idIndexMarker845"></a>pride. If, instead, we maintain a humble, respectful attitude towards everyone, good <a id="_idIndexMarker846"></a>qualities and inspiration will flow into our mind all the time, like streams flowing into a valley.</p>
