			<p id="_idParaDest-19" class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_00-Chapter-title---TOC-Level-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"></a>Exchanging Self with Others</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">Whereas the two previous chapters explain the practice of what is called ‘equalizing self and others’ – cherishing ourself and all other living beings equally – this chapter shows us how to <a id="_idIndexMarker847"></a>exchange self with others. This means that we give up our <a id="_idIndexMarker848"></a>self-cherishing and come to cherish only others. Because the main obstacles to gaining this realization are our delusions, I will now explain how we can overcome our delusions, and in particular our self-cherishing.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Normally we divide the external world into that which we consider to be good or valuable, bad or worthless, or neither. Most of the time these <a id="_idIndexMarker849"></a>discriminations are incorrect or have little meaning. For example, our habitual way of categorizing people as friends, enemies and strangers depending on how they make us feel is both incorrect and a great obstacle to developing impartial love for all living beings. Rather than holding so tightly to our discriminations of the external <a id="_idIndexMarker850"></a>world, it would be far more beneficial if we learnt to discriminate between valuable and worthless states of mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">To overcome a particular <a id="_idIndexMarker851"></a>delusion, we need to be able to identify it correctly and distinguish it clearly from other states of mind. It is relatively easy to identify <a id="_idIndexMarker852"></a>delusions such as <a id="_idIndexMarker853"></a>anger or <a id="_idIndexMarker854"></a>jealousy and to see how they are harming us. Delusions such as <a id="_idIndexMarker855"></a>attachment, <a id="_idIndexMarker856"></a>pride, self-grasping and self-cherishing, however, are more difficult to recognize and can easily be confused with other states of mind. For instance, we have many <a id="_idIndexMarker857"></a>desires, but not all of these are motivated by desirous attachment. We can have the wish to sleep, to eat, to meet our friends or to meditate, without being influenced by attachment. A desire that is attachment necessarily disturbs our mind, but, since it may affect us in subtle, indirect ways, we may find it difficult to recognize when it arises in our mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">WHAT IS SELF-CHERISHING?</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">Of all the innumerable conceptual thoughts that arise from the ocean of our root <a id="_idIndexMarker858"></a>mind, the most harmful is self-cherishing and the most beneficial is the mind of cherishing others. What exactly is <a id="_idIndexMarker859"></a>self-cherishing? Self-cherishing is our mind that thinks ‘I am important’ while neglecting others. It is defined as a mind that considers oneself to be supremely important and precious, and that develops from the appearance of true existence of the self. The delusion of self-cherishing is functioning in our mind almost all the time, and is at the very core of our <a id="_idIndexMarker860"></a>samsaric experience.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">It is our self-cherishing that makes us feel that our happiness and freedom are more important than anyone else’s, that our wishes and feelings matter more, and that our life and experiences are more interesting. Because of our self-cherishing we find it upsetting when we are criticized or insulted, but not when a stranger is <a id="_idIndexMarker861"></a>criticized, and we may even feel happy when someone we dislike is insulted. When we are in <a id="_idIndexMarker862"></a>pain we feel that the most important thing in the world is to stop our pain as quickly as possible, but we are far more patient when someone else is in pain. We are so <a id="_idIndexMarker863"></a>familiar with self-cherishing that we find it difficult to imagine life without it – for us it is almost as natural as breathing. However, if we check with our wisdom, we will see that self-cherishing is a completely mistaken mind with no basis in reality. There are no valid reasons whatsoever for thinking that we are more important than others. For <a id="_idIndexMarker864"></a>Buddhas, who have unmistaken <a id="_idIndexMarker865"></a>minds and see things exactly as they are, all beings are equally important.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Self-cherishing is a <a id="_idIndexMarker866"></a>wrong awareness because its observed <a id="_idIndexMarker867"></a>object, the inherently existent self or I, does not exist. The inherently existent self or I, the self or I that we normally see, and the truly existent self or I, are synonymous. If we watch our mind when <a id="_idIndexMarker868"></a>self-cherishing is manifesting strongly, such as when we are afraid, embarrassed or indignant, we will notice that we have a very vivid sense of I. Due to self-grasping ignorance, our I appears to us as a solid, real entity, existing from its own side, independently of our body or mind. This independent I is called the ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker869"></a>inherently existent I’, and it does not exist at all. The I that we grasp at so strongly, cherish so dearly, and devote our whole life to serving and protecting is merely a fabrication of our ignorance. If we reflect deeply on this point, we will realize how ridiculous it is to cherish something that does not exist. An explanation of how the inherently existent I does not exist is given in the chapter on ultimate bodhichitta.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Due to the <a id="_idIndexMarker870"></a>imprints of self-grasping accumulated since <a id="_idIndexMarker871"></a>beginningless time, whatever appears to our mind, including our I, appears to be <a id="_idIndexMarker872"></a>inherently existent. Grasping at our own self as inherently existent, we grasp at the self of others as inherently existent, and then conceive self and others to be inherently different. We then generate self-cherishing, which instinctively feels, ‘I am supremely important and precious.’ In summary, our self-grasping apprehends our I to be inherently existent, and our self-cherishing then cherishes that inherently existent I above all others. For <a id="_idIndexMarker873"></a>ordinary beings, <a id="_idIndexMarker874"></a>self-grasping and self-cherishing are very closely related and almost mixed together. We can say that they are both types of ignorance because they both mistakenly apprehend a non-existent object, the inherently existent I. Because any action motivated by these minds is a contaminated <a id="_idIndexMarker875"></a>action that causes us to be reborn in <a id="_idIndexMarker876"></a>samsara, it is also correct to say that for ordinary beings both self-grasping and self-cherishing are the root of samsara.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">There is a more subtle type of self-cherishing, which is not conjoined with self-grasping and which is therefore not a type of ignorance. This type of <a id="_idIndexMarker877"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker878"></a>self-cherishing exists in the minds of <a id="_idIndexMarker879"></a>Hinayana practitioners who have completely abandoned the ignorance of self-grasping and all other delusions, and achieved nirvana. However, they still have a subtle form of self-cherishing, which arises from the <a id="_idIndexMarker880"></a>imprints of self-grasping and prevents them from working for the sake of all sentient beings. An explanation of this type of self-cherishing is not within the scope of this book. Here, self-cherishing refers to the self-cherishing of ordinary beings, which is a deluded mind that cherishes a non-existent self and regards it as supremely important.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">THE <a id="_idIndexMarker881"></a>FAULTS OF SELF-CHERISHING</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para---space-below">It is impossible to find a single problem, misfortune or painful experience that does not arise from <a id="_idIndexMarker882"></a>self-<a id="_idIndexMarker883"></a>cherishing. As Bodhisattva <a id="_idIndexMarker884"></a>Shantideva says:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">All the happiness there is in this world</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">Arises from wishing others to be happy,</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">And all the suffering there is in this world</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---last">Arises from wishing ourself to be happy.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">How should we understand this? As mentioned earlier, all our experiences are the effects of actions we have committed in the past: pleasant experiences are the effects of positive actions, and unpleasant experiences are the effects of <a id="_idIndexMarker885"></a>negative actions. Sufferings are not given to us as a punishment. They all come from our self-cherishing mind, which wishes ourself to be happy while neglecting the happiness of others. There are two ways to understand this. First, the self-cherishing mind is the creator of all our suffering and problems; and second, self-cherishing is the basis for experiencing all our suffering and problems.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We suffer because in our previous lives we performed actions that caused others to experience suffering, motivated by selfish intention – our self-cherishing. As a result of these actions, we now experience our present suffering and problems. Therefore, the real creator of all our suffering and problems is our self-cherishing mind. If we never engaged in negative actions, it would be impossible for us to experience any unpleasant effects. All negative actions are motivated by delusions, which in turn arise from self-cherishing. First we develop the thought, ‘I am important’, and because of this we feel that the fulfilment of our wishes is of paramount importance. Then we desire for ourself that which appears attractive and develop <a id="_idIndexMarker886"></a>attachment, we feel aversion for that which appears unattractive and develop <a id="_idIndexMarker887"></a>anger, and we feel <a id="_idIndexMarker888"></a>indifference towards that which appears neutral and develop ignorance. From these three delusions, all other delusions arise. Self-grasping and self-cherishing are the roots of the tree of suffering, delusions such as anger and attachment are its trunk, <a id="_idIndexMarker889"></a>negative actions are its branches, and the miseries and pains of samsara are its bitter fruit.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">By understanding how <a id="_idIndexMarker890"></a>delusions develop, we can see that self-cherishing is at the very core of our negativity and suffering. Disregarding the happiness of others and selfishly pursuing our own interests, we perform many non-virtuous actions, the effects of which are only suffering. All the misery of disease, <a id="_idIndexMarker891"></a>sickness, natural disasters and<a id="_idIndexMarker892"></a> war can be traced back to self-cherishing. It is impossible to experience the suffering of sickness or any other misfortune if we have not at some time in the past created its cause, which is necessarily a non-virtuous action motivated by self-cherishing.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We should not take this to mean that a person’s suffering is his own fault and that it is therefore inappropriate to feel compassion for him. Motivated by their delusions, living beings perform negative actions, and whenever they are under the influence of delusions they are not in control of their minds. If a mental patient were to injure his head by banging it against a wall, the doctors would not refuse to treat him by arguing that it was his own fault. In the same way, if in a previous life someone performed a negative action that has now resulted in his experiencing a serious illness, this is no reason for us not to feel compassion for him. Indeed, by understanding that living beings are not free from the delusions that are the cause of all their suffering, our <a id="_idIndexMarker893"></a>compassion will become much stronger. To be able to help others effectively, we need a profoundly compassionate intention that wishes to free others from their manifest suffering and its underlying causes.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The self-cherishing mind is also the basis for experiencing all our <a id="_idIndexMarker894"></a>suffering and problems. For example, when people are unable to fulfil their wishes, many experience <a id="_idIndexMarker895"></a>depression, <a id="_idIndexMarker896"></a>discouragement, <a id="_idIndexMarker897"></a>unhappiness and mental pain, and some even want to <a id="_idIndexMarker898"></a>kill themselves. This is because their self-cherishing believes that their own wishes are so important. It is therefore their self-cherishing that is mainly responsible for their problems. Without self-cherishing, there would be no basis for experiencing such suffering.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">It is not difficult to see how the self-cherishing we have in this life causes us suffering. All disharmony, quarrelling and fighting come from the self-cherishing of the people involved. With self-cherishing we hold our opinions and interests very strongly and are not willing to see a situation from another point of view. As a consequence we easily get <a id="_idIndexMarker899"></a>angry and wish verbally or even physically to harm others. Self-cherishing makes us feel depressed whenever our wishes are not fulfilled, we fail in our ambitions or our life does not turn out the way we planned. If we examine all the times we have been miserable, we will discover that they are characterized by an excessive concern for our own welfare. If we lose our job, our home, our <a id="_idIndexMarker900"></a>reputation or our <a id="_idIndexMarker901"></a>friends we feel sad, but only because we deeply cherish ourself. We are not nearly so concerned when other people lose their jobs or are parted from their friends.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">In themselves, <a id="_idIndexMarker902"></a>external conditions are neither good nor bad. For example, wealth is generally thought of as desirable, but if we are strongly <a id="_idIndexMarker903"></a>attached to <a id="_idIndexMarker904"></a>wealth it will only cause us many worries and serve to deplete our merit. On the other hand, if our mind is governed principally by cherishing others, even losing all our money can be useful, for it gives us the opportunity to understand the suffering of those in similar situations and provides fewer <a id="_idIndexMarker905"></a>distractions from our spiritual practice. Even if we did fulfil all the wishes of our self-cherishing, there is no guarantee that we would be happy, for every samsaric attainment brings with it new problems and invariably leads to new <a id="_idIndexMarker906"></a>desires. The relentless pursuit of our selfish desires is like drinking <a id="_idIndexMarker907"></a>salt water to quench our thirst. The more we indulge our desires, the greater our thirst.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">When people <a id="_idIndexMarker908"></a>kill themselves, it is usually because their wishes were not fulfilled, but this was unbearable to them only because their self-cherishing made them feel that their wishes were the most important thing in the world. It is because of self-cherishing that we take our wishes and plans so seriously and are unable to accept and learn from the difficulties that life brings us. We do not become a better person just by fulfilling our wishes for worldly success; we are as likely to develop the qualities that really matter – such as wisdom, <a id="_idIndexMarker909"></a>patience and compassion – through our failures as through our successes.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We often feel that it is someone else who is making us unhappy, and we can become quite resentful. If we look at the situation carefully, however, we will find that it is always our own mental attitude that is responsible for our unhappiness. Another person’s actions make us unhappy only if we allow them to stimulate a negative response in us. <a id="_idIndexMarker910"></a>Criticism, for example, has no power from its own side to hurt us; we are hurt only because of our self-cherishing. With self-cherishing we are so dependent on the opinions and approval of others that we lose our freedom to respond and act in the most constructive way.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We sometimes feel that the reason we are unhappy is that someone we love is in trouble. We need to remember that at the moment our love for others is almost invariably mixed with <a id="_idIndexMarker911"></a>attachment, which is a self-centred mind. The love parents generally feel for their children, for example, is deep and genuine, but it is not always pure <a id="_idIndexMarker912"></a>love. Mixed with it are feelings such as the need to feel loved and appreciated in return, the belief that their children are somehow part of them, a desire to impress other people through their children, and the hope that their children will in some way fulfil their parents’ ambitions and dreams. It is sometimes very difficult to distinguish between our <a id="_idIndexMarker913"></a>love and our attachment for others, but, when we are able to do so, we will see that it is invariably the attachment that is the cause of our suffering. Pure unconditional love never causes any pain or worry but only peace and joy.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">All the <a id="_idIndexMarker914"></a>problems of human society, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker915"></a>war, crime, pollution, drug addiction, <a id="_idIndexMarker916"></a>poverty, injustice, and disharmony within families, are the result of self-cherishing. Thinking that human beings alone matter, and that the natural world exists to serve human desires, we have wiped out thousands of animal species and polluted the planet to such an extent that there is great danger it could soon be unfit even for human habitation. If everyone were to practise cherishing others, many of the major problems of the world would be solved in a few years.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Self-cherishing is like an iron chain that keeps us locked in samsara. The fundamental reason for our suffering is that we are in samsara, and we are in samsara because we continually create the deluded, self-centred actions that perpetuate the cycle of uncontrolled <a id="_idIndexMarker917"></a>rebirth. Samsara is the experience of a self-centred mind. The <a id="_idIndexMarker918"></a>six realms of samsara, from the god realm to the hell realm, are all the <a id="_idIndexMarker919"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker920"></a>dream-like projections of a mind distorted by self-cherishing and self-grasping. By causing us to see life as a constant struggle to serve and protect our own I, these two minds impel us to perform innumerable destructive <a id="_idIndexMarker921"></a>actions that keep us imprisoned in the nightmare of samsara. Until we destroy these two minds, we will never know true freedom or happiness, we will never really be in control of our mind, and we will never be safe from the threat of <a id="_idIndexMarker922"></a>lower rebirth.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Controlling our self-cherishing is of great value, even temporarily. All worries, anxiety and sadness are based on self-cherishing. The moment we let go of our obsessive concern for our own welfare, our mind naturally relaxes and becomes lighter. Even if we receive some bad news, if we manage to overcome our normal self-centred reaction our mind will remain at <a id="_idIndexMarker923"></a>peace. On the other hand, if we fail to subdue our self-cherishing, even the most petty things disturb us. If a friend criticizes us we immediately become upset, and the <a id="_idIndexMarker924"></a>frustration of even our smallest wishes leaves us dejected. If a Dharma Teacher says something we do not want to hear, we may become upset with him or her, or even lose our faith. Many people can get very agitated just because a <a id="_idIndexMarker925"></a>mouse comes into their room. Mice do not eat people, so what reason is there to become upset? It is only the foolish mind of self-cherishing that disturbs us. If we loved the mouse as much as we loved ourself we would welcome the mouse into our room, thinking, ‘He has as much right to be here as I have!’</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">For those who aspire to become enlightened, the worst fault is self-cherishing. Self-cherishing is the main obstacle to <a id="_idIndexMarker926"></a>cherishing others, failing to cherish others is the main obstacle to developing great compassion, and failing to develop <a id="_idIndexMarker927"></a>great compassion is the main obstacle to developing <a id="_idIndexMarker928"></a>bodhichitta and entering the path to enlightenment – the <a id="_idIndexMarker929"></a>Mahayana path. Since bodhichitta is the main cause of great <a id="_idIndexMarker930"></a>enlightenment, we can see that self-cherishing is also the main obstacle to the attainment of Buddhahood.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Although we might agree that objectively we are no more important than anyone else, and that self-cherishing has many faults, we may still feel that it is nevertheless indispensable. If we do not cherish and look after ourself, surely no one else will! This is a mistaken way of thinking. While it is true that we need to look after ourself, we do not need to be motivated by self-cherishing. Caring for ourself is not self-cherishing. We can take care of our health, have a job and look after our house and possessions solely out of concern for others’ welfare. If we view our <a id="_idIndexMarker931"></a>body as an instrument with which we can benefit others, we can feed it, clothe it, wash it and rest it – all without self-cherishing. Just as an ambulance driver can take care of his vehicle without regarding it as his own, so we can take care of our body and possessions for the benefit of others. The only way we can ever truly help all living beings is by becoming a <a id="_idIndexMarker932"></a>Buddha, and the human form is the best possible vehicle for accomplishing this. Therefore, we need to take good care of our body. If we do this with bodhichitta motivation, all our actions of caring for our body become part of the <a id="_idIndexMarker933"></a>path to enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We may sometimes confuse self-cherishing with <a id="_idIndexMarker934"></a>self-confidence and <a id="_idIndexMarker935"></a>self-respect, but in reality they are completely unrelated. It is not out of self-respect that we always want the best for ourself, nor is it out of self-respect that we deceive or exploit others, or fail in our responsibilities to them. If we check honestly, we will see that it is our self-cherishing that causes us to act in ways that rob us of our self-respect and destroy our confidence. Some people are driven by their self-cherishing to the depths of alcoholism or drug addiction, completely losing any modicum of self-respect in the process. On the other hand, the more we cherish others and act to benefit them, the greater our self-respect and confidence will become. The <a id="_idIndexMarker936"></a>Bodhisattva <a id="_idIndexMarker937"></a>vow, for example, in which the Bodhisattva promises to overcome all faults and limitations, attain all good qualities and work until all living beings are liberated from the sufferings of samsara, is an expression of tremendous self-confidence, far beyond that of any self-centred being.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We might also ask, ‘If I had no self-cherishing, would that not mean that I dislike myself? Surely it is necessary to accept and love myself, for if I cannot <a id="_idIndexMarker938"></a>love myself how can I love others?’ This is an important point. In <a id="_idIndexMarker939"></a><span class="_1---Italic">Training the Mind in Seven Points</span>, Geshe <a id="_idIndexMarker940"></a>Chekhawa explains a number of <a id="_idIndexMarker941"></a>commitments that serve as guidelines for practitioners of training the mind. The first of these states: ‘Do not allow your practice of training the mind to cause inappropriate behaviour.’ This commitment advises such practitioners to be happy with themselves. If we are excessively self-critical, we will turn in upon ourself and become discouraged, and this will make it very difficult for us to turn our mind to cherishing others. Although it is necessary to be aware of our <a id="_idIndexMarker942"></a>faults, we should not hate ourself for them. This commitment also advises us to take care of ourself and look after our needs. If we try to live without basic necessities such as sufficient food and shelter we will probably damage our health and undermine our capacity to benefit others. Moreover, if people see us behaving in an extreme way, they may conclude that we are unbalanced and consequently will not trust us or believe what we say; and under such circumstances we will not be able to help them. Abandoning self-cherishing completely is not easy and will take a long time. If we are not happy with ourself, or foolishly neglect our own well-being, we will have neither the confidence nor the energy to effect such a radical spiritual transformation.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Once we are free from self-cherishing we do not lose our wish to be happy, but we understand that real <a id="_idIndexMarker943"></a>happiness is to be found in <a id="_idIndexMarker944"></a>benefiting others. We have discovered an inexhaustible fountain of happiness within our own mind – our love for others. Difficult external <a id="_idIndexMarker945"></a>conditions do not depress us and pleasant conditions do not overexcite us, for we are able to transform and enjoy both. Rather than focusing on gathering good external conditions, our desire for happiness is channelled into a determination to attain enlightenment, which we recognize as the only means of achieving pure <a id="_idIndexMarker946"></a>happiness. Though we long to enjoy the ultimate <a id="_idIndexMarker947"></a>bliss of full enlightenment we do so solely for the sake of others, for attaining <a id="_idIndexMarker948"></a>enlightenment is merely the means to fulfil our real wish, which is to bestow the same happiness on all living beings. When we become a <a id="_idIndexMarker949"></a>Buddha our happiness radiates eternally as <a id="_idIndexMarker950"></a>compassion, nourishing all living beings and gradually drawing them into the same state.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">In short, self-cherishing is an utterly worthless and unnecessary mind. We may be highly <a id="_idIndexMarker951"></a>intelligent, but if we are concerned only with our own welfare we can never fulfil our basic wish to find happiness. In reality, self-cherishing makes us stupid. It causes us to experience unhappiness in this life, leads us to perform countless negative actions that cause suffering in future lives, binds us to samsara and blocks the path to enlightenment. <a id="_idIndexMarker952"></a>Cherishing others has the opposite effects. If we cherish only others we will be happy in this life, we will perform many <a id="_idIndexMarker953"></a>virtuous actions that lead to happiness in future lives, we will become free from the <a id="_idIndexMarker954"></a>delusions that keep us in samsara, and we will quickly develop all the qualities needed to attain full enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">HOW TO STOP DEVELOPING <a id="_idIndexMarker955"></a>SELF-CHERISHING</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">If we have realized <a id="_idIndexMarker956"></a>emptiness, the mere absence of things that we normally see – of which there is a detailed explanation in the chapter <span class="_1---Italic">Ultimate Bodhichitta</span> – we should think from our heart, ‘The object of my <a id="_idIndexMarker957"></a>self-cherishing is only my self that I normally see, which actually does not exist. Thus, I must stop developing self-cherishing because its object – my <a id="_idIndexMarker958"></a>self that I normally see – does not exist.’ We then meditate on this determination again and again. Out of meditation we do not allow ourself to cherish ourself that we normally see by remembering that it does not exist. Through continually applying effort to practise this special method, which is an oral instruction, we can easily stop developing self-cherishing. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">However, as I previously said, in general abandoning self-cherishing is not easy, so there now follows a detailed explanation of how to stop developing self-cherishing. From our heart we mentally repeat again and again the instructions explained above on the faults of self-cherishing and the benefits of cherishing others. Having deep familiarity with contemplating the meaning of these instructions, we make a strong determination not to allow ourself to think and believe that we are more important than others. We then meditate on this determination. We should practise this contemplation and meditation continually. Between meditation sessions we should apply effort to putting our determination into practice. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Having made the determination to overcome our <a id="_idIndexMarker959"></a>self-cherishing, the next step is to recognize it the moment it arises in our mind. To do this we need to examine our <a id="_idIndexMarker960"></a>mind throughout the day and the night. This means that we should practise like Geshe <a id="_idIndexMarker961"></a>Ben Gungyal, and watch our own mind in everything we think and believe. Usually we keep an eye on what other people are doing, but it would be far better if we kept an eye all the time on what our mind is thinking and believing. Whenever we are working, talking, relaxing or studying Dharma, one part of our mind should always be watching to check what thoughts are arising in our mind. As soon as a <a id="_idIndexMarker962"></a>delusion of self-cherishing is about to arise, we should try to stop it immediately. If we catch a delusion in its early stages, it is quite easy to stop, but if we allow it to develop fully it becomes very difficult to control.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">One of our most destructive delusions is self-cherishing. The reason we naturally develop self-cherishing is that we have never applied effort in learning to stop the initial development of self-cherishing. If we catch our mind as soon as it starts to focus on the object of our self-cherishing, our inherently existent self or I, it is quite easy to prevent self-cherishing from arising and to channel our thoughts in a more constructive direction. All we need do is say to ourself, ‘This is an inappropriate way of thinking and will soon give rise to self-cherishing, which has many faults.’ However, if we fail to catch our self-cherishing early on and allow it to grow, it will soon become extremely powerful and very difficult to overcome. The same is true of all other delusions. If we become aware of a deluded train of thought early on, we can easily avert it, but, if we allow it to continue, it will gather momentum until it becomes almost impossible to stop.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">There are three levels of abandoning delusions. The first is to recognize a particular delusion as it is about to arise and, remembering its disadvantages, to prevent it from manifesting. As long as we keep a watch over our mind, this is quite straightforward, and is something we should try to practise all the time, whatever we are doing. In particular, as soon as we notice that our mind is becoming tense or <a id="_idIndexMarker963"></a>unhappy we should be especially vigilant, for such a mind is a perfect breeding ground for delusions. For this reason, in <a id="_idIndexMarker964"></a><span class="_1---Italic">Training the Mind in Seven Points</span> Geshe <a id="_idIndexMarker965"></a>Chekhawa says, ‘Always rely upon a happy mind alone.’</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The second level of abandoning our delusions is to subdue them by applying their specific <a id="_idIndexMarker966"></a>opponents. For example, to subdue our attachment, we can meditate on the faults of samsara and replace our <a id="_idIndexMarker967"></a>attachment with the opposite mind of <a id="_idIndexMarker968"></a>renunciation. Through meditating on the path to enlightenment in a regular, systematic way, we not only prevent deluded patterns of thinking and feeling from arising but we also replace them with strong and stable virtuous patterns, based on <a id="_idIndexMarker969"></a>wisdom rather than ignorance. In this way, we can prevent most delusions from arising in the first place. For instance, through deep <a id="_idIndexMarker970"></a>familiarity with the view that others are more important than ourself, self-cherishing will rarely arise.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The third level of abandoning our delusions is to abandon them completely, together with their <a id="_idIndexMarker971"></a>seeds, by gaining a direct <a id="_idIndexMarker972"></a>realization of emptiness. In this way we destroy self-grasping, which is the root of all delusions.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">In the practice of <a id="_idIndexMarker973"></a>equalizing self and others that was explained earlier, we think, ‘Just as my happiness is important, so too is the happiness of everyone else’; and in this way we share our feeling of cherishing. Because this appeals to our sense of fairness and does not directly challenge our self-cherishing mind, it is easier to accept and practise. We can also reflect that, no matter how much we may suffer, we are only one single person whereas other living beings are countless, so it is obviously important for them to experience peace and happiness. Although we regard each of our fingers and thumbs as precious, we would be prepared to sacrifice one to save the other nine, whereas sacrificing nine to save one would be absurd. Similarly, nine people are more important than one, so of course <a id="_idIndexMarker974"></a>countless <a id="_idIndexMarker975"></a>living beings are more important than one self alone. It follows that it is logical to cherish others at least as much as we cherish ourself.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Having gained some familiarity with the practice of equalizing self and others, we are ready to confront the self-cherishing mind more directly. Because self-cherishing has so many faults, we should encourage ourself to confront and overcome it the moment it arises in our mind. By keeping a close watch over our mind all the time, we can train ourself to recognize <a id="_idIndexMarker976"></a>self-cherishing the moment it arises and then immediately recall its disadvantages. Geshe <a id="_idIndexMarker977"></a>Chekhawa advises us to ‘Gather all blame into one’, by which he means that we should blame self-cherishing for all our problems and suffering. Normally when things go wrong we blame others, but the real cause of our problems is our self-cherishing mind. Once we have correctly identified self-cherishing, we should regard it as our worst <a id="_idIndexMarker978"></a>enemy and blame it for all our suffering. Although it is good to be <a id="_idIndexMarker979"></a>tolerant of others and to forgive their weaknesses, we should never tolerate our self-cherishing, for the more lenient we are with it the more it will harm us. It is far better to be utterly ruthless and blame it for everything that goes wrong. If we want to be angry with something, we should be angry with the ‘demon’ of our self-cherishing. In reality, <a id="_idIndexMarker980"></a>anger directed against self-cherishing is not real anger, for it is based on wisdom rather than ignorance and functions to make our mind pure and peaceful.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">To practise in this way, we need to be very skilful. If, as a result of <a id="_idIndexMarker981"></a>blaming our self-cherishing for all our problems, we find ourself feeling <a id="_idIndexMarker982"></a>guilty and inadequate, this indicates that we have not made a clear distinction between blaming our self-cherishing and blaming ourself. Although it is true that self-cherishing is to blame for all our problems, this does not mean that we ourself are to blame. Once again, we have to learn to distinguish between ourself and our <a id="_idIndexMarker983"></a>delusions. If we are attacked it is not our <a id="_idIndexMarker984"></a>fault but the fault of our self-cherishing. How? Because it is the karmic effect of a non-virtuous action we performed in a previous life under the influence of self-cherishing. Moreover, our attacker harms us only because of his or her self-cherishing, and blaming him will not help, for it will only make us bitter. However, if we place all the blame on our self-cherishing mind and resolve to destroy it, we will not only remain undisturbed but also undermine the basis for all our future suffering.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">This teaching on recognizing the faults of our self-cherishing and subsequently developing the desire to overcome it is not easy to put into practice, and so we need to be <a id="_idIndexMarker985"></a>patient. A practice that is suitable for one person is not necessarily suitable for someone else, and a <a id="_idIndexMarker986"></a>practice that is appropriate for one person at one time is not necessarily appropriate for that same person at another time. Buddha did not expect us to put all his teachings into practice right away; they are intended for a great variety of practitioners of different levels and dispositions. There are also some instructions that cannot be practised while we are emphasizing other practices, just as it is not appropriate to drink tea and coffee together at the same time. Dharma <a id="_idIndexMarker987"></a>instructions are like medicine and need to be administered skilfully, taking into account the nature of the individual and his or her particular needs. For example, to encourage us to develop <a id="_idIndexMarker988"></a>renunciation, the wish to attain liberation from samsara, Buddha gave extensive teachings on how ordinary life is in the nature of suffering – but not everyone can apply these teachings right away. For some people, meditating on <a id="_idIndexMarker989"></a>suffering only causes them to become despondent. Instead of developing a joyful mind of renunciation, they just get depressed. For these people it is better for the time being not to meditate on suffering but to come back to it later when their minds are stronger and their wisdom clearer.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If we practise advanced teachings and find that our pride or confusion increases, this indicates that we are not yet ready for such teachings and should first emphasize building a firm foundation of basic practices. If any <a id="_idIndexMarker990"></a>meditation or practice is not having a good effect on our mind, is making us unhappy or is increasing our delusions, this is a clear sign that we are practising incorrectly. Rather than stubbornly pushing at the practice, it may be better to put it to one side for the time being and seek advice from senior practitioners. We can go back to that practice once we understand where we are going wrong and what is the correct way of practising. What we should never do, however, is reject any Dharma instruction by thinking, ‘I will never practise this.’</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">When we go <a id="_idIndexMarker991"></a>shopping, we do not feel impelled to buy everything in the store, but it is useful to remember what the store stocks so that we can return later when we need something. In a similar way, when we listen to Dharma teachings, we may not immediately be able to practise all that we hear, but it is still important to remember everything so that we can build up a comprehensive understanding of Dharma. Later, when we are ready, we can put the instructions we have heard into practice. One of the great advantages of the instructions of <a id="_idIndexMarker992"></a>Lamrim – the <a id="_idIndexMarker993"></a>stages of the path to enlightenment – is that it gives us a structure, or storehouse, within which we can keep all the Dharma teachings we have heard.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If we remember only those teachings that we are immediately able to apply in our present situation, when our circumstances change we will have nothing to fall back on. However, if we can remember all the teachings we have received, we will have at our disposal a huge range of instructions that we can apply at the appropriate time. A practice that may seem obscure and of little significance to us now may later become an essential part of our spiritual practice. What is important is to proceed carefully and at our own pace, otherwise we might feel confused or discouraged and may even end up rejecting Dharma altogether.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">There is no greater spiritual practice than recognizing self-cherishing whenever it arises and then blaming it for all our problems. It does not matter how long we spend on this; even if it takes years or our whole life, we need to continue until our self-cherishing is completely destroyed. We should not be in a hurry to see results, but instead practise patiently and sincerely. Expecting quick results is itself based on self-cherishing and is a recipe for disappointment. If we practise with joy and steadfastness, while at the same time <a id="_idIndexMarker994"></a>purifying negativity, accumulating <a id="_idIndexMarker995"></a>merit and receiving <a id="_idIndexMarker996"></a>blessings, we will definitely succeed in reducing and finally abandoning our self-cherishing.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Even when our meditation is not going well, we can practise mindfulness and <a id="_idIndexMarker997"></a>alertness in our daily life and stop self-cherishing as soon as it arises. This is a simple practice but it has great results. If we train in it continuously, our problems will disappear and we will naturally be happy all the time. There are people who have succeeded in completely abandoning their self-cherishing and who now cherish only others. As a result, all their <a id="_idIndexMarker998"></a>problems have disappeared and their minds are always filled with joy. I guarantee that the less you cherish yourself and the more you cherish others the <a id="_idIndexMarker999"></a>happier you will become.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We should keep a strong determination in our heart to abandon our self-cherishing mind. If we apply <a id="_idIndexMarker1000"></a>armour-like effort in this determination day by day, year by year, our self-cherishing will gradually diminish and eventually cease altogether. The early <a id="_idIndexMarker1001"></a>Kadampa <a id="_idIndexMarker1002"></a>Geshes would often say that to lead a virtuous life all we need to do is harm our delusions as much as possible and benefit others as much as possible. Understanding this, we should wage continuous warfare against our inner enemy of self-cherishing and strive to cherish and benefit others instead.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">To destroy our self-cherishing completely, we need to rely upon the practice of exchanging self with others, in which we no longer grasp at our own happiness but instead feel that all living beings, and their needs and wishes, are of supreme importance. Our only concern is for the well-being of others.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Although someone who has completely exchanged himself with others has no self-cherishing, this does not mean that he does not look after himself. He does look after himself, but for the sake of others. He regards himself as a servant of all living beings and as belonging to them; but even servants need to eat and rest if they are to be effective. It would generally be very foolish, for example, if we were to give away all we owned, leaving ourself with nothing to live on or to sustain our spiritual practice. Since our real wish is to <a id="_idIndexMarker1003"></a>benefit all living beings, and the only way we can do this is by becoming a Buddha, we need to protect our spiritual practice by organizing our life so that we are able to practise in the most effective way. Moreover, when we help others, we should also make sure that in helping one person we are not undermining our capacity to help many people. Although in our hearts we would gladly give away everything we have to help one person, practically we need to manage our time and resources so that we can be of the greatest benefit to all living beings.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The practice of exchanging self with others belongs to the special <a id="_idIndexMarker1004"></a>wisdom <a id="_idIndexMarker1005"></a>lineage that came from Buddha <a id="_idIndexMarker1006"></a>Shakyamuni through <a id="_idIndexMarker1007"></a>Manjushri and <a id="_idIndexMarker1008"></a>Shantideva to <a id="_idIndexMarker1009"></a>Atisha and <a id="_idIndexMarker1010"></a>Je Tsongkhapa. The <a id="_idIndexMarker1011"></a>bodhichitta that is developed through this method is more profound and powerful than the bodhichitta developed through other methods. Although everyone with an interest in spiritual development can reduce their self-cherishing and learn to cherish others, a complete <a id="_idIndexMarker1012"></a>realization of exchanging self with others is a very profound attainment. To transform our mind in such a radical way, we need deep <a id="_idIndexMarker1013"></a>faith in this practice, an abundance of <a id="_idIndexMarker1014"></a>merit, and powerful <a id="_idIndexMarker1015"></a>blessings from a <a id="_idIndexMarker1016"></a>Spiritual Guide who has personal experience of these teachings. With all these conducive conditions, the practice of exchanging self with others is not difficult.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We may wonder why it is necessary to cherish others more than ourself. Rather than aiming for such high spiritual realizations, would it not be better just to emphasize helping people in a practical way right now? Without <a id="_idIndexMarker1017"></a>compassion and <a id="_idIndexMarker1018"></a>wisdom we do not know whether helping people in practical ways may benefit them or harm them. We should know that the happiness or peace of mind that comes from worldly enjoyments is not real happiness, but is just changing <a id="_idIndexMarker1019"></a>suffering or a reduction of previous suffering. People need the happiness and peace of mind that comes from wisdom. The wisdom realizing the meaning of the instructions on exchanging self with others will bring pure and everlasting <a id="_idIndexMarker1020"></a>happiness.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">The reason why we need to train our mind in exchanging self with others is because our self-cherishing interferes with both our intention and our ability to <a id="_idIndexMarker1021"></a>benefit others. With self-cherishing we do not have unbiased, universal <a id="_idIndexMarker1022"></a>love for all living beings, and for as long as our desire to help them is mixed with self-cherishing we can never be sure that our actions will actually benefit them. Although we may genuinely want to help some people, such as our family, our friends or those in need, we usually expect something back in return, and are hurt and disappointed if this is not forthcoming. Since our wish to benefit is mixed with selfish concerns, our help nearly always comes with the strings of expectation or personal reward. Because our intention is impure, our ability to help lacks power and remains limited.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If, while making no effort to eliminate our self-cherishing, we claim to be working for the benefit of all, our claim is coming from our mouth and not from our heart and our <a id="_idIndexMarker1023"></a>wisdom. Of course we should help others practically whenever we can, but we should always remember that our main intention is to develop our mind. By training in exchanging self with others we will finally experience the ultimate happiness of <a id="_idIndexMarker1024"></a>Buddhahood and possess complete power to benefit all living beings. Only then will we be in a position to say, ‘I am a benefactor of all living beings.’ In this way, our training in exchanging self with others accomplishes both our own and others’ purpose.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">Our most important task at the moment is to <a id="_idIndexMarker1025"></a>train our mind, and in particular to strengthen our <a id="_idIndexMarker1026"></a>intention to be of service to others. In his <a id="_idIndexMarker1027"></a><span class="_1---Italic">Friendly Letter</span> <a id="_idIndexMarker1028"></a>Nagarjuna says that although we may not have the ability to help others now, if we keep the intention to do so in mind all the time, our ability to help them will gradually increase. This is because the more we cherish others, the more our merit, wisdom and capacity to actually benefit them will increase, and opportunities to help in practical ways will naturally present themselves.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE SELF WITH OTHERS?</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para"><a id="_idIndexMarker1029"></a>Exchanging self with others does not mean that we become the other person – it means that we exchange the object of our cherishing from ourself to others. To understand how this is possible we should understand that the object of our <a id="_idIndexMarker1030"></a>self-cherishing mind is always changing. When we are young the object of our self-cherishing is a young girl or boy, but later it changes to a teenager, then to a middle-aged person and finally to an old person. At the moment, we may cherish ourself as a particular human being called Maria or John, but after we die the object of our cherishing will completely change. In this way, the object of our cherishing is continually changing, both during this life and from one life to the next. Since our cherishing naturally changes from one object to another, it is definitely possible through training in meditation for us to change the object of our cherishing from self to others.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Due to our ignorance we <a id="_idIndexMarker1031"></a>grasp at our body very strongly, thinking, ‘This is my <a id="_idIndexMarker1032"></a>body.’ Identifying with this body as ‘mine’, we cherish and love it dearly, feeling it to be our most precious possession. In reality, however, our body belongs to others; we did not bring it with us from our previous life but received it from our parents of this life. At the moment of conception our consciousness entered into the union of our father’s sperm and mother’s ovum, which gradually developed into our present body. Our mind then identified with this body and we began to cherish it. As Shantideva says in <a id="_idIndexMarker1033"></a><span class="_1---Italic">Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</span>, our body is not really our own but belongs to others; it was produced by others, and after our death will be disposed of by others. If we contemplate this carefully, we will realize that we are already cherishing an object that in reality belongs to others, so why can we not cherish other living beings? Furthermore, whereas cherishing our body only leads to rebirth within samsara, cherishing others is a cause for attaining the <a id="_idIndexMarker1034"></a>nirvana of full enlightenment, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1035"></a>state beyond sorrow.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">‘<a id="_idIndexMarker1036"></a>Self’ and ‘other’ are relative terms, rather like ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker1037"></a>this mountain’ and ‘that mountain’ but not like ‘donkey’ and ‘horse’. When we look at a horse, we cannot say that it is a donkey, and likewise we cannot say that a donkey is a horse. However, if we climb a mountain in the east we call it ‘this mountain’ and we call the mountain to the west ‘that mountain’; but if we climb down the eastern mountain and up the western mountain we then refer to the western mountain as ‘this mountain’ and to the eastern mountain as ‘that mountain’. ‘This’ and ‘that’ therefore depend upon our point of reference. This is also true of self and other. By climbing down the mountain of self, it is possible to ascend the mountain of other, and thereby cherish others as much as we presently cherish ourself. We can do this by recognizing that, from another person’s point of view, it is he or she who is self while it is we who are other.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">Those who are skilled in <a id="_idIndexMarker1038"></a>Secret Mantra, or <a id="_idIndexMarker1039"></a>Tantra, have a profound experience of exchanging self with others. In the Tantric practice of <a id="_idIndexMarker1040"></a>self-generation, we exchange our present self with that of a Tantric <a id="_idIndexMarker1041"></a>Buddha. Suppose there is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1042"></a>Vajrayogini practitioner called Sarah. Whenever she is not engaged in Tantric practice, her ordinary body appears to her and she identifies with it and cherishes it. When she concentrates deeply on self-generation meditation, however, the sense of being Sarah and having Sarah’s body completely disappears. Instead of identifying with Sarah’s body, the practitioner identifies with the divine <a id="_idIndexMarker1043"></a>body of Buddha Vajrayogini and develops the thought, ‘I am Vajrayogini.’ The practitioner has now entirely changed the object of cherishing from the <a id="_idIndexMarker1044"></a>impure body of an ordinary being to the uncontaminated body of an enlightened being, Buddha Vajrayogini. Through training in meditation, the practitioner develops deep <a id="_idIndexMarker1045"></a>familiarity with the body of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1046"></a>Deity and comes to identify with it completely. Because Vajrayogini’s body is a pure body, identifying with it and cherishing it is a cause of enlightenment. From this we can see that it is definitely possible to change our basis of identification – it just depends upon our <a id="_idIndexMarker1047"></a>motivation and our familiarity. A detailed explanation of Tantric practice can be found in the books <a id="_idIndexMarker1048"></a><span class="_1---Italic">Modern Buddhism</span>, <span class="_1---Italic">The </span><span class="_1---Italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1049"></a></span><span class="_1---Italic">New Guide to Dakini Land</span> and <a id="_idIndexMarker1050"></a><span class="_1---Italic">Tantric Grounds and Paths</span>.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">THE ACTUAL PRACTICE OF <a id="_idIndexMarker1051"></a>EXCHANGING SELF WITH OTHERS</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para---space-below">We think:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---meditation---single"><span class="_1---Italic">I have worked for my own purpose since beginningless time, trying to find happiness for myself and avoid suffering, but what do I have to show for all my efforts? I am still suffering. I still have an uncontrolled mind. I still experience disappointment after disappointment. I am still in samsara. This is the fault of my </span><span class="_1---Italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1052"></a></span><span class="_1---Italic">self-cherishing. It is my worst enemy and a terrible poison that harms both myself and others.</span></p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---meditation---single"><a id="_idIndexMarker1053"></a>Cherishing others, however, is the basis of all happiness and goodness. Those who are now <a id="_idIndexMarker1054"></a>Buddhas saw the futility of working for their own purpose and decided to work for others instead. As a result, they became pure beings, free from all the problems of samsara, and they attained the lasting happiness of full enlightenment. I must reverse my ordinary childish attitude: from now on I will stop cherishing myself and cherish only others.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para---space-below">With an understanding of the great disadvantages of cherishing ourself and the great advantages of cherishing all living beings, as explained above, and remembering that we have made the determination to abandon our self-cherishing and always cherish all living beings without exception, we think from the depths of our heart:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---meditation---single">I must give up cherishing myself and instead cherish all other living beings without exception.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">We then meditate on this determination. We should continually practise this meditation until we spontaneously believe that the happiness and freedom of each and every other living being are far more important than our own. This belief is the realization of exchanging self with others, and will give rise to a deep feeling of cherishing love for all living beings. We meditate on this feeling for as long as we can.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We try to carry this feeling with us during the meditation break. Whoever we meet, we think, ‘This person is important. Their happiness and freedom are important.’ Whenever self-cherishing begins to arise in our mind, we think, ‘Self-cherishing is poison; I will not allow it in my mind.’ In this way we can change our object of cherishing from ourself to all living beings. When we have developed spontaneous <a id="_idIndexMarker1055"></a>cherishing love for all living beings we have gained the realization of exchanging self with others.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If our wishes are not fulfilled and we begin to feel unhappy, we should immediately remember that the fault lies not with the other person or the situation but with our own self-cherishing mind, which instinctively feels, ‘My wishes are of paramount importance.’ Remaining continually mindful of the dangers of our self-cherishing will strengthen our resolve to abandon it, and, instead of feeling sorry for ourself when we have problems, we can use our own <a id="_idIndexMarker1056"></a>suffering to remind us of the suffering of countless mother beings and develop love and compassion for them.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">In <a id="_idIndexMarker1057"></a><span class="_1---Italic">Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</span>, <a id="_idIndexMarker1058"></a>Shantideva explains a special method to enhance our experience of exchanging self with others. In meditation we imagine that we exchange places with another person, and we try to see the world from his or her point of view. Normally we develop the thought ‘I’ on the <a id="_idIndexMarker1059"></a>basis of our own body and mind, but now we try to think ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker1060"></a>I’ observing the body and mind of another person. This practice helps us to develop a profound empathy with other people, and shows us that they have a self that is also an I, and that is just as important as our own self or I. Because of her ability to identify with the feelings of her baby, a <a id="_idIndexMarker1061"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1062"></a>mother is able to understand her child’s needs and wishes far better than other people. Similarly, as we become familiar with this meditation, our understanding of and <a id="_idIndexMarker1063"></a>empathy with other people will increase.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">This technique is particularly powerful when we apply it to someone with whom we have a difficult relationship, such as someone we dislike or see as our rival. By imagining we are that person, and seeing the situation from his or her point of view, we will find it difficult to hold onto our deluded attitudes. Understanding the relativity of self and other from our own experience, and learning to see our ‘<a id="_idIndexMarker1064"></a>self’ as ‘other’, we will become far more objective and impartial towards our self, and our sense that we are the centre of the universe will be shaken. We will become more open to others’ point of view, more <a id="_idIndexMarker1065"></a>tolerant and more understanding; and we will naturally treat others with greater respect and <a id="_idIndexMarker1066"></a>consideration. More details on this practice are given in the book <a id="_idIndexMarker1067"></a><span class="_1---Italic">Meaningful to Behold</span>.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para _idGenParaOverride-1">In summary, through practising the instructions of <a id="_idIndexMarker1068"></a>training the mind, Bodhisattva <a id="_idIndexMarker1069"></a>Langri Tangpa and countless other practitioners of the past have attained profound spiritual <a id="_idIndexMarker1070"></a>realizations, including the complete realization of exchanging self with others. At the beginning, these practitioners were self-centred people just like us, but through constant perseverance they managed to eliminate their self-cherishing completely. If we practise these instructions wholeheartedly and patiently, there is no reason why we too should not attain similar realizations. We should not expect to destroy our self-cherishing immediately, but through patient practice it will gradually become weaker and weaker until it eventually ceases altogether.</p>
