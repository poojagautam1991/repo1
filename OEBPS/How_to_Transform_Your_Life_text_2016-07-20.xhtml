			<p id="_idParaDest-20" class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_00-Chapter-title---TOC-Level-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1071"></a>Great Compassion</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">Having gained some experience of cherishing all living beings, we can now extend and deepen our <a id="_idIndexMarker1072"></a>compassion, and the method for doing so is revealed in this chapter. In general, everyone already has some compassion. We all feel compassion when we see our <a id="_idIndexMarker1073"></a>family or <a id="_idIndexMarker1074"></a>friends in distress, and even <a id="_idIndexMarker1075"></a>animals feel compassion when they see their offspring in pain. Our compassion is our Buddha seed or Buddha nature, our <a id="_idIndexMarker1076"></a>potential to become a Buddha. It is because all living beings possess this seed that they will all eventually become Buddhas.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">When a <a id="_idIndexMarker1077"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1078"></a>dog sees her puppies in pain, she develops the wish to protect them and free them from pain, and this compassionate wish is her <a id="_idIndexMarker1079"></a>Buddha seed. Unfortunately, however, animals have no ability to train in compassion, and so their Buddha seed cannot ripen. Human beings, though, have a great opportunity to develop their Buddha nature. Through meditation we can extend and deepen our compassion until it transforms into the mind of universal, or great, compassion – the sincere wish to liberate all living beings permanently from suffering. Through improving this mind of universal compassion it will eventually transform into the compassion of a Buddha, which actually has the power to liberate all living beings. Therefore, the way to become a Buddha is to awaken our compassionate Buddha nature and complete the training in universal compassion. Only human beings can do this.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below"><a id="_idIndexMarker1080"></a>Compassion is the very essence of a spiritual life and the main <a id="_idIndexMarker1081"></a>practice of those who have devoted their lives to attaining enlightenment. It is the root of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1082"></a>Three Jewels – <a id="_idIndexMarker1083"></a>Buddha, <a id="_idIndexMarker1084"></a>Dharma and <a id="_idIndexMarker1085"></a>Sangha. It is the root of Buddha because all Buddhas are born from compassion. It is the root of Dharma because Buddhas give Dharma teachings motivated solely by <a id="_idIndexMarker1086"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1087"></a>compassion for others. It is the root of Sangha because it is by listening to and practising Dharma teachings given out of compassion that we become Sangha, or <a id="_idIndexMarker1088"></a>Superior beings.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">WHAT IS COMPASSION?</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">What exactly is <a id="_idIndexMarker1089"></a>compassion? Compassion is a mind that is motivated by cherishing other living beings and wishes to release them from their suffering. Sometimes out of selfish intention we can wish for another person to be free from their suffering; this is quite common in relationships that are based principally on <a id="_idIndexMarker1090"></a>attachment. If our friend is ill or depressed, for example, we may wish him to recover quickly so that we can enjoy his company again, but this wish is basically self-centred and is not true compassion. True compassion is necessarily based on cherishing others.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">Although we already have some degree of compassion, at present it is very biased and limited. When our family and <a id="_idIndexMarker1091"></a>friends are suffering, we easily develop compassion for them, but we find it far more difficult to feel sympathy for people we find unpleasant or for strangers. Furthermore, we feel compassion for those who are experiencing manifest pain, but not for those who are enjoying good conditions, and especially not for those who are engaging in harmful actions. If we genuinely want to realize our potential by attaining full enlightenment we need to increase the scope of our compassion until it embraces all living beings without exception, just as a loving <a id="_idIndexMarker1092"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1093"></a>mother feels compassion for all her children irrespective of whether they are behaving well or badly. Unlike our present, limited compassion, which already arises naturally from time to time, universal compassion must first be cultivated through training over a long period of time.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">HOW TO DEVELOP <a id="_idIndexMarker1094"></a>COMPASSION</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">There are two essential stages to cultivating compassion. First we need to cherish others, and then, on the basis of cherishing others, we need to contemplate their suffering. Through this we will naturally develop compassion for them. Normally, when we see our enemy suffering we do not develop compassion because we do not cherish him or her. This is the opposite to the way in which we react when we see our friend suffering. This is because we cherish him or her. Cherishing others is the foundation for developing compassion. The way to develop and enhance our mind of cherishing love has already been explained. Now we must contemplate how each and every samsaric being is experiencing suffering.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">To begin with, we can think about those who are <a id="_idIndexMarker1095"></a>suffering intense manifest <a id="_idIndexMarker1096"></a>pain right now. There are so many people experiencing terrible mental and physical suffering from illnesses such as <a id="_idIndexMarker1097"></a>cancer, <span class="_1---Small-Caps _idGenCharOverride-1">AIDS</span> and Parkinson’s disease. How many people have lost a beloved child or friend through the scourge of cancer, watching him become weaker and weaker, knowing that it is difficult to cure? Every day, thousands of people experience the agony of <a id="_idIndexMarker1098"></a>dying from illnesses or in accidents. Without choice they are separated forever from everyone they love, and those they leave behind often experience inconsolable grief and <a id="_idIndexMarker1099"></a>loneliness. Imagine an old woman losing her husband and lifelong partner, sadly returning home after the funeral to an empty house to live out the rest of her days alone.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Throughout the world we can see how millions of people are suffering through the horrors of <a id="_idIndexMarker1100"></a>war and ethnic cleansing, from bombing, landmines and massacres. Suppose it was your child who went out to play in the fields and lost a limb, or even his very life, by stepping on a landmine? Hundreds of thousands of refugees throughout the world live in squalid camps, hoping someday to return to their ruined homes, many of them waiting to be reunited with their loved ones, every day not knowing if they are alive or dead.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Every year natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and hurricanes devastate whole communities and leave people homeless and hungry. A few short seconds of an earthquake can kill thousands of people, destroy their homes and bury everything under tons of rubble. Think how we would feel if this were to happen to us. Famine and drought are endemic in many countries throughout the world. So many people live on a subsistence diet, barely scraping together one meagre meal a day, while others who are less fortunate succumb and die of starvation. Imagine the torment of watching your loved ones slowly waste away, knowing that there is nothing you can do. Whenever we read, listen to or watch the news, we see living beings who are in terrible pain, and we all personally know people who are experiencing immense mental or physical suffering.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We can especially consider the plight of countless animals who experience extremes of heat and cold, and suffer great hunger and thirst. Every day, all around us, we can see the <a id="_idIndexMarker1101"></a>suffering of <a id="_idIndexMarker1102"></a>animals. Animals in the wild are in almost constant fear of being prey to others, and indeed many of them are eaten alive by predators. Just think of the terror and pain a field <a id="_idIndexMarker1103"></a>mouse experiences when caught and ripped to shreds by a hawk! Countless animals are kept by humans for labour, food or entertainment, and often live in disgusting conditions until they are slaughtered, butchered and packaged for human consumption. <a id="_idIndexMarker1104"></a>Hungry ghosts and <a id="_idIndexMarker1105"></a>hell beings have to experience far worse sufferings for inconceivably long periods of time.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We also need to remember that even those who are not presently experiencing manifest pain still experience other forms of suffering. Everyone in samsara experiences the suffering of not fulfilling their wishes. So many people find it difficult to satisfy even modest desires for adequate shelter, food or companionship; and, even if those desires are fulfilled, we have more to take their place. The more we get what we want, the stronger our <a id="_idIndexMarker1106"></a>attachment becomes; and the stronger our attachment, the more difficult it is to find satisfaction. The <a id="_idIndexMarker1107"></a>desires of samsaric beings are endless. There is no such thing as an ordinary person who has fulfilled all his or her wishes; only those who have transcended selfish minds can do this.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">All suffering is the result of negative karma. If we develop compassion for those who are experiencing the effects of their previous negative actions, why can we not also develop compassion for those who are creating the cause to experience suffering in the future? In the long term a torturer is in a worse position than his victim, for his suffering is just beginning. If the victim can accept his or her pain without developing hatred, he will exhaust that particular negative karma and not create any more; and so his suffering has an end in sight. The torturer, on the other hand, will first have to endure many aeons in hell, and then, when he is again reborn as a human being, will have to experience pain similar to that which he inflicted on the victim. For this reason it is entirely appropriate to develop strong compassion for such people.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If a child burns himself by putting his hand in a fire, this will not stop his mother from feeling compassion, even if the child has been previously warned about the dangers of fire. No one wants to suffer, yet out of ignorance living beings create the causes of suffering – non-virtuous actions – because they are controlled by their <a id="_idIndexMarker1108"></a>delusions. We should therefore feel equal compassion for all living beings – for those who are creating the causes of suffering, as much as for those who are already suffering the consequences of their unskilful actions. There is not a single living being who is not a suitable object of our compassion.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We may also find it difficult to feel compassion for the rich, healthy and well respected, who do not appear to be experiencing any manifest pain. In reality, however, they too experience a great deal of mental suffering and find it hard to maintain a peaceful mind. They worry about their money, their bodies and their reputation. Like all other samsaric beings, they suffer from anger, attachment and ignorance, and have no choice but to undergo the sufferings of birth, ageing, sickness and death unceasingly and relentlessly, life after life. Moreover, their wealth and good conditions are utterly meaningless if, through their ignorance, they use them only to create the cause for future suffering.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">If, on the basis of cherishing all living beings, we contemplate the fact that they experience the cycle of physical suffering and mental pain in life after life without end, their inability to liberate themselves from suffering, their lack of freedom and how, by engaging in negative actions, they create the causes of future suffering, we will develop deep compassion for them. We need to <a id="_idIndexMarker1109"></a>empathize with them and feel their pain as keenly as we feel our own. Finally, we concentrate on developing <a id="_idIndexMarker1110"></a>universal compassion, the sincere wish to permanently liberate all living beings from the sufferings of this life and countless future lives. We contemplate as follows:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---prose---single"><span class="_1---Italic">All living beings suffer because they take </span><span class="_1---Italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1111"></a></span><span class="_1---Italic">contaminated rebirths. </span><span class="_1---Italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1112"></a></span><span class="_1---Italic">Human beings have no choice but to experience immense human sufferings because they have taken human rebirth, which is contaminated by the inner poison of delusions. Similarly, animals have to experience animal </span><span class="_1---Italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1113"></a></span><span class="_1---Italic">suffering, and </span><span class="_1---Italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1114"></a></span><span class="_1---Italic">hungry ghosts and hell beings</span><span class="_1---Italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1115"></a></span><span class="_1---Italic"> have to experience all the sufferings of their respective realms. If living beings were to experience all this suffering for just one single life it would not be so bad, but the </span><span class="_1---Italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1116"></a></span><span class="_1---Italic">cycle of suffering continues life after life, endlessly.</span></p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">From the depths of our heart we should then understand and think:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---meditation---single">I cannot bear the suffering of these countless mother beings. Drowning in the vast and deep ocean of samsara, the cycle of contaminated rebirth, they have to experience unbearable physical suffering and mental pain in this life and in countless future lives. I must liberate all living beings permanently from the cycle of suffering.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para---full-space-below">We should meditate continually on this determination, which is universal <a id="_idIndexMarker1117"></a>compassion, and apply great effort to fulfilling its aim.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">THE SUPREME <a id="_idIndexMarker1118"></a>WEALTH OF COMPASSION</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">During the <a id="_idIndexMarker1119"></a>meditation break we should continually maintain our feeling of compassion for all living beings. Whenever we encounter anyone, we should recall how they are suffering and develop compassion for them. Then, just seeing a living being will be like finding a rare and precious treasure. This is because the compassion we experience upon meeting others is a supreme inner wealth that is an inexhaustible source of benefit for us in both this and future lives.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">As mentioned earlier, <a id="_idIndexMarker1120"></a>external wealth cannot help us in our future lives, and even in this life it is not certain that it will bring us happiness for it is often the cause of much anxiety and can even endanger our life. Rich people have particular worries that poor people never have; for example, they often worry about thieves, about investments and interest rates, and about losing their money and social status. This is a heavy burden for them. Whereas most people can go out freely whenever they choose, many wealthy and famous people need bodyguards and may even worry about being kidnapped. Rich people have little freedom or independence and can never fully relax. The higher up we are in the world the further we have to fall; it is safer to be nearer the bottom.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">No matter how much we succeed in improving our external conditions, they can never bring us pure <a id="_idIndexMarker1121"></a>happiness nor provide real protection from suffering. True happiness cannot be found in this impure world. Instead of striving to obtain external wealth, it would be far better if we sought the internal <a id="_idIndexMarker1122"></a>wealth of compassion and wisdom, for, unlike external <a id="_idIndexMarker1123"></a>wealth, this can never deceive us and will definitely bring us the peace and happiness we desire.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If we are skilful, <a id="_idIndexMarker1124"></a>friends can be like treasure chests, from whom we can obtain the precious wealth of <a id="_idIndexMarker1125"></a>love, compassion, patience and so forth. For our friends to function in this way, however, our love for them must be free from <a id="_idIndexMarker1126"></a>attachment. If our love for our friends is mixed with strong <a id="_idIndexMarker1127"></a>attachment, it will be conditional upon their behaving in ways that please us and, as soon as they do something we disapprove of, our liking for them may turn to anger. In fact, the most common objects of our <a id="_idIndexMarker1128"></a>anger are often our friends, not our enemies or strangers!</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If we often get angry with our friends, we are transforming them into maras. A <a id="_idIndexMarker1129"></a>mara, or obstructing demon, is someone or something that interferes with our <a id="_idIndexMarker1130"></a>spiritual practice. No one is a mara from his or her own side, but if we allow people to stimulate in us deluded minds such as anger, strong attachment or self-cherishing we transform them into maras for us. A mara does not need to have horns and a terrifying expression; someone who appears to be a good friend, who flatters us and leads us into meaningless activities, can be a greater obstacle to our spiritual practice. Whether our friends are precious treasures or maras depends entirely upon us; if we are sincerely practising patience, compassion and love, they can be like priceless jewels, but if we are often getting angry with them, they can become maras.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We would be delighted to find a treasure chest buried beneath the ground or to win a large sum of money, and would consider ourself very fortunate. However, if we consider the deceptiveness of external wealth and the superiority of the inner wealth of virtue, how much more fortunate should we feel whenever we meet another living being, the potential source of limitless inner wealth? For sincere, compassionate practitioners, just seeing other living beings, speaking with them, or merely thinking about them is like finding buried treasure. All their encounters with other people serve to enhance their compassion, and even everyday activities such as shopping or talking to friends become causes of enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Of all virtuous minds, compassion and wisdom are supreme. Compassion purifies our mind, and when our mind is pure its objects also become pure. There are many accounts of spiritual practitioners who, by developing strong compassion, <a id="_idIndexMarker1131"></a>purified their minds of the negativity that had long been obstructing their spiritual progress. For example, <a id="_idIndexMarker1132"></a>Asanga, a great scholar who lived in India in the fifth century <span class="_1---Small-Caps _idGenCharOverride-1">AD</span>, meditated in an isolated mountain cave in order to gain a vision of Buddha <a id="_idIndexMarker1133"></a>Maitreya. After twelve years he still had not succeeded and, feeling discouraged, abandoned his retreat. On his way down the mountain he came across an old dog lying in the middle of the path. Its body was covered in maggot-infested sores and it seemed close to death. This sight induced within Asanga an overwhelming feeling of compassion for all living beings trapped within samsara. As he was painstakingly removing the maggots from the dying <a id="_idIndexMarker1134"></a>dog, Buddha Maitreya suddenly appeared to him. Maitreya explained that he had been with Asanga since the beginning of his retreat, but, due to the impurities in Asanga’s mind, Asanga had not been able to see him. It was Asanga’s extraordinary compassion that had finally purified the karmic obstructions preventing him from seeing Maitreya. In reality the dog had been an <a id="_idIndexMarker1135"></a>emanation of Buddha Maitreya all along – Maitreya emanated as a suffering dog for the purpose of arousing Asanga’s compassion. We can see from this how Buddhas manifest in many different ways to help living beings.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Anyone who dies with a mind of pure compassion will definitely be reborn in a Pure Land, where he or she will never again have to experience the sufferings of samsara. The Bodhisattva Geshe <a id="_idIndexMarker1136"></a>Chekhawa’s main wish was to be reborn in hell so that he could help the beings suffering there. However, as he lay on his deathbed he perceived a vision of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1137"></a>Pure Land and realized that his wish would not be fulfilled. Instead of being reborn in hell, he had no choice but to go to the Pure Land! This was because his compassion had purified his mind to such an extent that, from the point of view of his own experience, impure objects such as <a id="_idIndexMarker1138"></a>hell realms no longer existed – for him everything was pure. However, although Geshe Chekhawa took rebirth in a Pure Land, he was able to help hell beings<a id="_idIndexMarker1139"></a> through his emanations<a id="_idIndexMarker1140"></a>.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We may find these stories difficult to believe, but this is because we do not understand the relationship between our <a id="_idIndexMarker1141"></a>mind and its <a id="_idIndexMarker1142"></a>objects. As <a id="_idIndexMarker1143"></a>Milarepa said, our <a id="_idIndexMarker1144"></a>mind and its objects are in truth the same nature, but due to <a id="_idIndexMarker1145"></a>ignorance we believe they are different natures. We feel that the world exists ‘out there’, independent of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1146"></a>mind that perceives it, but in reality objects are totally dependent on the minds that perceive them. This impure world that we presently experience exists only in relation to our impure <a id="_idIndexMarker1147"></a>mind. Once we have completely purified our mind through training in exchanging self with others, compassion and so forth, this impure <a id="_idIndexMarker1148"></a>world will disappear and we will perceive a new, pure world. Our sense that things exist separately from our mind, with their own fixed, inherent natures, comes from our ignorance. When we understand the true nature of things, we will see that our <a id="_idIndexMarker1149"></a>world is like a <a id="_idIndexMarker1150"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1151"></a>dream, in that everything exists as a <a id="_idIndexMarker1152"></a>mere appearance to mind. We will realize that we can change our world simply by changing our mind, and that, if we wish to be free from suffering, all we need to do is purify our mind. Having purified our own <a id="_idIndexMarker1153"></a>mind, we will then be in a position to fulfil our compassionate wish by showing others how to do the same.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Considering all these benefits of compassion, we should resolve to make use of every opportunity to develop it. The most important thing is to put the teachings on compassion and wisdom into practice, for both our own and others’ purposes, otherwise for us they will remain just empty words. The nature and functions of <a id="_idIndexMarker1154"></a>wisdom are explained in the section on training in higher wisdom in the chapter <span class="_1---Italic">Meaningful Objects</span>.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Pure compassion is a mind that finds the suffering of others unbearable, but it does not make us depressed. In fact, it gives us tremendous energy to work for others and to complete the <a id="_idIndexMarker1155"></a>spiritual path for their sake. It shatters our complacency and makes it impossible to rest content with the superficial <a id="_idIndexMarker1156"></a>happiness of satisfying our worldly desires, yet in its place we will come to know a deep inner <a id="_idIndexMarker1157"></a>peace that cannot be disturbed by changing conditions. It is impossible for strong delusions to arise in a mind filled with compassion. If we do not develop <a id="_idIndexMarker1158"></a>delusions, <a id="_idIndexMarker1159"></a>external circumstances alone have no power to disturb us; so when our mind is governed by compassion it is always at peace. This is the experience of all those who have developed their compassion beyond the limited compassion normally felt for those we feel close to into a selfless compassion for all living beings.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para _idGenParaOverride-1">Developing compassion and <a id="_idIndexMarker1160"></a>wisdom, and helping those in need whenever possible, is the true meaning of <a id="_idIndexMarker1161"></a>human life. By increasing our compassion we come closer to enlightenment and to the fulfilment of our deepest wishes. How <a id="_idIndexMarker1162"></a>kind living beings are to act as the objects of our compassion! How precious they are! If there were no suffering beings left for us to help, Buddhas would have to <a id="_idIndexMarker1163"></a>emanate them for us! Indeed, if we consider the story of <a id="_idIndexMarker1164"></a>Maitreya and <a id="_idIndexMarker1165"></a>Asanga, we will see that we have no way of knowing for sure whether those we are presently trying to help are not in fact emanations of Buddha manifested for our benefit. The indication that we have mastered the meditations on cherishing others and compassion is that whenever we meet another person, even someone who is harming us, we genuinely feel as if we had found a rare and <a id="_idIndexMarker1166"></a>precious treasure.</p>
