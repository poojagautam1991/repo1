			<p id="_idParaDest-22" class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_00-Chapter-title---TOC-Level-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"></a>Taking and Giving</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">Through the practice of <a id="_idIndexMarker1212"></a>taking and giving, we can further improve our love and compassion. In dependence upon this practice we can develop superior <a id="_idIndexMarker1213"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1214"></a>bodhichitta, which is the gateway through which we can enter the path to enlightenment. As mentioned above, <a id="_idIndexMarker1215"></a>enlightenment is the inner light of wisdom that is permanently free from all mistaken appearance, and whose function is to bestow peace of mind upon each and every living being every day. It is the source of all happiness.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">When we first meditate on taking and giving, we cannot actually take on the suffering of others nor give them our happiness but, by imagining that we are doing so now, we are training our mind to be able to do so in the future. At the moment we are unable to benefit all living beings but we have the <a id="_idIndexMarker1216"></a>potential for this ability, which is part of our Buddha nature<a id="_idIndexMarker1217"></a>. Through practising the meditations on taking and giving with strong compassion for all living beings, the potential to be able to benefit all living beings will ripen, and when this happens we will become an enlightened being, a <a id="_idIndexMarker1218"></a>Buddha. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">‘<a id="_idIndexMarker1219"></a>Taking’ in this context means taking others’ sufferings upon ourself through meditation. When we start our practice of taking and giving we do not need to think too much about how it is possible to relieve others’ suffering through the power of our imagination alone. Instead, we should simply practise <a id="_idIndexMarker1220"></a>taking and giving with a good motivation, understanding it to be a supreme method for increasing our merit, or good fortune, and the power of our concentration. This practice also causes our mind and actions to become pure, so that we can accomplish everything easily. Through sincere training, our meditation on taking and giving will become so powerful that we will develop the ability directly to take on the suffering of others and give them happiness.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">There are many examples of accomplished practitioners using the power of their concentration to take on the suffering of other beings with whom they have a <a id="_idIndexMarker1221"></a>karmic connection. There is a story of a great scholar and meditator called <a id="_idIndexMarker1222"></a>Maitriyogi who took on the pain of a <a id="_idIndexMarker1223"></a>dog that was being beaten, so that the wounds appeared on his body instead of the dog’s. The great Tibetan <a id="_idIndexMarker1224"></a>Yogi <a id="_idIndexMarker1225"></a>Milarepa had completely mastered the meditation on taking and giving. On one occasion he took on a man’s suffering, but the man refused to believe that it was due to Milarepa that he was free from pain. To prove it, Milarepa returned the <a id="_idIndexMarker1226"></a>pain to him, and when the pain became too much Milarepa then transferred the pain to a door, which started to shake! Faithful Buddhist practitioners believe that when their <a id="_idIndexMarker1227"></a>Spiritual Guide is <a id="_idIndexMarker1228"></a>ill, in reality he or she is taking on the suffering of others. Many Christians also believe that by allowing himself to be crucified Jesus was taking on the sufferings of human beings. It is quite possible that <a id="_idIndexMarker1229"></a>Jesus was practising taking while he was on the cross.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If <a id="_idIndexMarker1230"></a>Buddhas and high <a id="_idIndexMarker1231"></a>Bodhisattvas have the power directly to take on the suffering of others and bestow happiness upon them, we may wonder why living beings are still <a id="_idIndexMarker1232"></a>suffering. Because Buddhas have this power, they are continuously bestowing blessings on all living beings. As a direct result of receiving these <a id="_idIndexMarker1233"></a>blessings, each and every living being, including animals and hell beings, occasionally experiences <a id="_idIndexMarker1234"></a>peace of mind, and at these times they are happy and free from manifest suffering. However, the only way living beings can achieve permanent <a id="_idIndexMarker1235"></a>liberation from suffering is by actually putting Buddha’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1236"></a>teachings into practice. Just as a doctor cannot cure a disease unless the sick person actually takes the medicine that the doctor has prescribed, so Buddhas cannot cure our inner disease of delusions unless we actually take the medicine of Dharma. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">Even when the sun is shining, if our house is shuttered only a little light can enter and our house will remain cold and dark; but, if we open the shutters, the warm rays of the sun will come pouring in. Similarly, even though the sun of Buddha’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1237"></a>blessings is always shining, if our mind is shuttered by our lack of faith, few blessings can enter and our mind will remain cold and dark; but, by developing strong <a id="_idIndexMarker1238"></a>faith, our mind will open and the full sun of Buddha’s blessings will come pouring in. Faith is the life force of spiritual practice. We need to have unshakeable faith in Buddha’s teachings, otherwise we will never apply effort to putting these teachings into practice.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker1239"></a>TAKING BY MEANS OF COMPASSION</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">For non-humans, such as animals or even gods, <a id="_idIndexMarker1240"></a>suffering only causes them distress and unhappiness, and they cannot learn anything from their pain. By contrast, humans who have met Buddhadharma can learn a great deal from their suffering. For us, suffering can be a great incentive to develop renunciation, compassion and bodhichitta, and can encourage us to engage in sincere purification practice.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">When the Buddhist Master Je <a id="_idIndexMarker1241"></a>Gampopa was a young lay man he was happily married to a beautiful young woman, but before long she fell ill and died. Because of his deep attachment to his wife, Gampopa was grief-stricken, but his loss made him realize that <a id="_idIndexMarker1242"></a>death and suffering are the very nature of samsara and this encouraged him to seek permanent <a id="_idIndexMarker1243"></a>liberation from <a id="_idIndexMarker1244"></a>samsara, the cycle of impure life, through practising Dharma purely. First he relied upon a number of <a id="_idIndexMarker1245"></a>Kadampa <a id="_idIndexMarker1246"></a>Geshes and practised Kadam <a id="_idIndexMarker1247"></a>Lamrim, and later he met <a id="_idIndexMarker1248"></a>Milarepa and received the <a id="_idIndexMarker1249"></a>Mahamudra instructions. Finally, by sincerely practising all the teachings he had heard, he became a great Master who led many beings along spiritual paths. Thus, we can see that, for the qualified Dharma practitioner, suffering has many good qualities. For these practitioners, samsara’s sufferings are like a <a id="_idIndexMarker1250"></a>Spiritual Guide who leads them along the path to enlightenment. As <a id="_idIndexMarker1251"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1252"></a>Shantideva says:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">Moreover, suffering has many good qualities.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">Through experiencing it, we can dispel pride,</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">Develop compassion for those trapped in samsara,</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---last">Abandon non-virtue, and delight in virtue.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">Also, <a id="_idIndexMarker1253"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1254"></a>Atisha, the founder of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1255"></a>Kadampa tradition, says:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">If, through being encouraged by his or her own suffering,</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---middle">A person sincerely wishes to liberate others from their suffering,</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---last">Such a practitioner is a person of great scope.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">Understanding the good qualities of our own <a id="_idIndexMarker1256"></a>suffering, which is <a id="_idIndexMarker1257"></a>wisdom, we should develop great joy at our opportunity to practise taking by means of compassion.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">TAKING ON OUR OWN FUTURE SUFFERING</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">To prepare ourself for the actual meditation on <a id="_idIndexMarker1258"></a>taking on others’ suffering, we can begin by taking on our own future suffering. This meditation is a powerful method for <a id="_idIndexMarker1259"></a>purifying the negative karma, or actions, that is the main cause of our future suffering. If we remove the cause of our future suffering, there will be no basis to experience the effect. Freedom from future suffering is more important than freedom from present suffering because our future suffering is endless whereas our present suffering is just the suffering of one short life. Therefore, while we still have the opportunity to purify the causes of our future suffering, we should train in taking on this suffering. This practice also serves to reduce our <a id="_idIndexMarker1260"></a>self-cherishing, which is the main reason why we find our suffering so difficult to bear, and it also strengthens our patience. When through the practice of <a id="_idIndexMarker1261"></a>patiently accepting our own suffering we can happily endure our adversities, it will not be difficult to take on the suffering of others. In this way, we gain the ability to prevent our own suffering and to benefit others. Understanding this, we make a determination to purify our non-virtues by taking on their effects now.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We imagine that all the sufferings we will experience in the future as a human, god, demi-god, animal, hungry ghost or hell being gather together in the aspect of black smoke and dissolve into our ignorance of self-grasping and self-cherishing at our heart. We strongly believe that our ignorance of self-grasping and self-cherishing is completely destroyed, and that we have purified the negative potentialities in our mind, the cause of all our future suffering. We then meditate on this belief for as long as possible. We should repeat this meditation on taking on our future suffering many times, until we receive signs that our negative karma has been purified. From engaging in this meditation we will experience a joy that will encourage us to develop a sincere wish to take on the suffering of others by means of compassion.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">We can also prepare for the actual meditation on taking others’ suffering by making <a id="_idIndexMarker1262"></a>prayers. It is very easy to say prayers, and if we say them with a good heart and strong concentration they are very powerful. While concentrating on the meaning, and believing that the living Buddha <a id="_idIndexMarker1263"></a>Shakyamuni is present in front of us, we pray:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---italic-middle">Therefore, O Compassionate, Venerable Guru, I seek your blessings</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---italic-middle">So that all the suffering, negativities and obstructions of mother sentient beings</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---verse---italic-last">Will ripen upon me right now.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para---full-space-below">We feel joy at the thought of taking on the suffering of all living beings, and we hold this special feeling for as long as possible. By repeating this prayer day and night, we continually strengthen our sincere wish to take on the suffering of others. We then engage in the actual meditation on taking on others’ suffering.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">THE BENEFITS OF TAKING ON OTHERS’ SUFFERING</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">There are four main benefits of the meditations on taking and giving<a id="_idIndexMarker1264"></a>: they are powerful methods (1) to purify<a id="_idIndexMarker1265"></a> the potentialities of non-virtuous actions<a id="_idIndexMarker1266"></a> that cause us to experience serious diseases such as cancer<a id="_idIndexMarker1267"></a>; (2) to accumulate a great collection of merit; (3) to ripen our <a id="_idIndexMarker1268"></a>potentiality to be able to benefit all living beings; and (4) to purify our mind. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">When we purify our mind through the practices of taking and giving, every spiritual realization<a id="_idIndexMarker1269"></a> will grow easily in our mind. Through contemplating the four main benefits of meditating on taking and giving, we should encourage ourself to practise these meditations sincerely.  </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Through meditating on taking the sufferings of all living beings we will develop a very strong mind that can bear adversity with courage. At present our mind is like an open wound – at the slightest hint of hardship we recoil in dismay. With such a weak mind even minor difficulties interfere with our Dharma practice. By training in taking, however, we can strengthen our mind until it becomes unshakeable. The <a id="_idIndexMarker1270"></a>Kadampa <a id="_idIndexMarker1271"></a>Geshes used to pray to develop a mind that is as strong and stable as a blacksmith’s anvil, which does not break however hard it is struck. We need a strong and stable mind, one that is undisturbed by any hardship that life throws at us. With such a mind, we are like a <a id="_idIndexMarker1272"></a>hero or heroine, and nothing can interfere with our progress towards enlightenment.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Those with deep experience of the practice of taking can easily fulfil their own and others’ wishes. Why is this? It is because they have so much <a id="_idIndexMarker1273"></a>merit and because their wishes are always pure and motivated by compassion. They can even fulfil their wishes by means of <a id="_idIndexMarker1274"></a>prayer or simply by declaring the truth.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">There are many stories of <a id="_idIndexMarker1275"></a>Bodhisattvas performing miraculous feats through the power of their <a id="_idIndexMarker1276"></a>declaration of truth. These declarations are very powerful because they are motivated by bodhichitta, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1277"></a>bodhichitta derives its power from great compassion. When I was a young monk at <a id="_idIndexMarker1278"></a>Jampaling Monastery in Western Tibet, I was seriously ill for a few months. When the pain got so bad that I could hardly bear it, my Teacher Geshe <a id="_idIndexMarker1279"></a>Palden came to see me. He had a blessed mala and would often tell us how special it was, but we used to think he was joking. However, on this occasion he stood by my bedside and said to me, ‘If it is true that my <a id="_idIndexMarker1280"></a>mala is blessed by the Wisdom Buddha <a id="_idIndexMarker1281"></a>Manjushri, may you soon be cured’, and then blessed me by touching my crown with the mala. After this, I recovered completely.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">THE ACTUAL MEDITATION ON TAKING</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">There are two ways of training in <a id="_idIndexMarker1282"></a>taking by means of compassion. The first is to focus on all living beings in general and imagine taking on their suffering, and the second is to focus on particular living beings and imagine taking on their sufferings.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">To practise the first method, we visualize ourself surrounded by the assembly of all mother living beings without exception. For auspiciousness, and to help us relate to them more easily, we can visualize them all in human aspect, but we should remember that each of them is experiencing the suffering of their own particular realm. It is not necessary to perceive them clearly – a rough mental image will suffice.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">Then, from the depths of our heart, we should think: </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---quotation---prose---single"><span class="_1---Italic">In their countless future lives all these mother living beings will have to experience the immeasurable </span><span class="_1---Italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1283"></a></span><span class="_1---Italic">sufferings of animals, hungry ghosts and hell beings, and the immeasurable sufferings of humans, demi-gods and gods, in life after life, endlessly. I cannot bear this! How wonderful it would be if they attained permanent </span><span class="_1---Italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker1284"></a></span><span class="_1---Italic">liberation from these sufferings! May they attain this liberation. I myself will work for this liberation now. </span></p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Thinking in this way, we imagine that the sufferings of all living beings gather together in the aspect of black smoke. This dissolves into our ignorance of self-grasping<a id="_idIndexMarker1285"></a> and self-cherishing<a id="_idIndexMarker1286"></a> at our heart. We then strongly believe that all living beings are permanently freed from suffering, and that our ignorance of self-grasping and self-cherishing is completely destroyed. We meditate on this belief single-pointedly for as long as possible. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">With compassion for all living beings we should continually practise this meditation until we experience signs that indicate our mind has been purified<a id="_idIndexMarker1287"></a>. These signs can include the curing of any sickness<a id="_idIndexMarker1288"></a> we may have had, the reducing of our delusions<a id="_idIndexMarker1289"></a>, our having a more peaceful and happy mind, the increasing of our faith<a id="_idIndexMarker1290"></a>, correct <a id="_idIndexMarker1291"></a>intention and correct view, and especially the strengthening of our experience of universal compassion<a id="_idIndexMarker1292"></a>.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We may think our <a id="_idIndexMarker1293"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1294"></a>belief that living beings have attained permanent liberation from suffering through our meditation is incorrect, because living beings have not actually attained this. Although it is true that living beings have not actually attained permanent liberation, our belief is still correct because it arises from our compassion and wisdom, and especially from the power of our <a id="_idIndexMarker1295"></a>concentration. Meditating on this belief will cause our <a id="_idIndexMarker1296"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1297"></a>potentiality of being able to liberate all living beings permanently from suffering to ripen quickly, so that we will attain enlightenment quickly. Therefore we should never abandon such a beneficial belief, which is the nature of <a id="_idIndexMarker1298"></a>wisdom. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">It is true that at first we do not have the power directly to take on others’ suffering, but through repeatedly meditating on the conviction that we have taken on their suffering we will gradually develop the actual power to do so. Meditation on taking is the <a id="_idIndexMarker1299"></a>quick path to <a id="_idIndexMarker1300"></a>enlightenment, and is similar to the Tantric practice of <a id="_idIndexMarker1301"></a>bringing the result into the path, in which through strongly imagining that we are already a Buddha we gradually become a Buddha. The fact is that if we cannot even imagine attaining <a id="_idIndexMarker1302"></a>enlightenment we will never be able to attain it! According to the teachings of training the mind the practice of taking and giving is similar to the practice of <a id="_idIndexMarker1303"></a>Secret Mantra, or <a id="_idIndexMarker1304"></a>Tantra. It is said that Tantric realizations<a id="_idIndexMarker1305"></a> can be achieved simply through relying upon correct belief and imagination. This practice is very simple: all we need to do is to become deeply familiar with meditation on correct belief and imagination, as presented in Tantra, by applying continual effort. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">How is it possible for something that exists only in our imagination to become a reality? It is a remarkable quality of the mind that we first create <a id="_idIndexMarker1306"></a>objects with our <a id="_idIndexMarker1307"></a>imagination and then bring them into our everyday reality. In fact everything starts in the imagination. For example, the house we are presently living in was first created in the imagination of the architect. He or she then made a design on paper, which acted as the blueprint for the actual building. If no one had first imagined our house it would never have been built. In reality, our <a id="_idIndexMarker1308"></a>mind is the creator of all we experience. All external creations such as money, cars and computers were developed in dependence upon someone’s imagination; if no one had imagined them they would never have been invented. In the same way, all inner creations and all Dharma <a id="_idIndexMarker1309"></a>realizations, even <a id="_idIndexMarker1310"></a>liberation and <a id="_idIndexMarker1311"></a>enlightenment, are developed in dependence upon <a id="_idIndexMarker1312"></a>correct imagination. Therefore for both <a id="_idIndexMarker1313"></a>worldly and spiritual attainments the imagination is of primary importance.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If we imagine something that could in theory exist and then familiarize our mind with it for long enough, eventually it will appear directly to our mind, first to our <a id="_idIndexMarker1314"></a>mental awareness and then even to our <a id="_idIndexMarker1315"></a>sense awarenesses. For as long as the object is still just an imagined object, the mind that apprehends it is simply a <a id="_idIndexMarker1316"></a>belief. If the object is a beneficial one it is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1317"></a>correct belief, and if the object stimulates delusions it is an incorrect belief. A belief is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1318"></a>conceptual <a id="_idIndexMarker1319"></a>mind that apprehends its object by means of a <a id="_idIndexMarker1320"></a>generic, or mental, image of that object. If we meditate on a correct belief for long enough, the generic image will become progressively more transparent until eventually it disappears entirely and we perceive the object directly. The imagined object will then have become a real object. By meditating on the beneficial belief that we have liberated all sentient beings and destroyed our self-cherishing mind, eventually we will actually accomplish this. Our correct belief will have transformed into a <a id="_idIndexMarker1321"></a>valid cognizer, a completely reliable mind.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">In the second way of training in taking by means of compassion we take on the sufferings of particular individuals or groups of living beings throughout infinite worlds. For example, we focus on the assembly of living beings who experience the suffering of <a id="_idIndexMarker1322"></a>sickness, and develop compassion. We then think:</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---meditation---single">These living beings experience the suffering of sickness in this life and in their countless future lives without end. How wonderful it would be if these living beings were permanently freed from sickness! May they achieve this. I myself will work for them to achieve this. I must do this.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">Thinking in this way, we imagine that the suffering of sickness of all living beings gathers together in the aspect of black smoke. This dissolves into our ignorance of self-grasping<a id="_idIndexMarker1323"></a> and self-cherishing at our heart. We then strongly believe that all these living beings are permanently freed from sickness, and that our ignorance of self-grasping and <a id="_idIndexMarker1324"></a>self-cherishing is completely destroyed. We meditate on this belief single-pointedly for as long as possible.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">In the same way, we can practise the meditation on taking while focusing on a particular individual or group of living beings who are experiencing other sufferings such as poverty, fighting and famine. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Whenever we are experiencing a particular <a id="_idIndexMarker1325"></a>problem, whether from sickness, lack of resources, or our delusions, we can think about the countless sentient beings who are experiencing similar problems, and then with a compassionate motivation we imagine taking on their suffering. This will help us deal with our own problem, and, by <a id="_idIndexMarker1326"></a>purifying the negative karma that prolongs the problem, may even rid us of it. If we are suffering from strong attachment, for example, we can consider all those who are also suffering from <a id="_idIndexMarker1327"></a>attachment, develop compassion for them, and imagine that we take on all their attachment together with the suffering it causes. This is a powerful method for destroying our own attachment.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Taking, motivated by compassion, is an extremely pure mind, unstained by self-cherishing. When our mind is pure, this in turn makes all our <a id="_idIndexMarker1328"></a>actions pure so that we become a pure being. If we die with strong compassion for all living beings we will definitely be born in the Pure Land<a id="_idIndexMarker1329"></a> of a Buddha. This is because our compassion that manifests when we are dying will directly cause our potential<a id="_idIndexMarker1330"></a> for taking rebirth<a id="_idIndexMarker1331"></a> in the Pure Land of a Buddha to ripen. This is the good result of a good heart<a id="_idIndexMarker1332"></a>. The result of maintaining the good heart of sincerely wishing to liberate permanently all living beings from suffering is that we ourself will experience permanent liberation<a id="_idIndexMarker1333"></a> from suffering by taking rebirth in the Pure Land of a Buddha.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">To conclude our meditation sessions on taking we dedicate our merit to freeing all sentient beings from their suffering and problems, and to lasting peace in this world.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker1334"></a>GIVING BY MEANS OF LOVE</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">‘<a id="_idIndexMarker1335"></a>Giving’ in this context means, with a pure mind of wishing love, giving our own happiness to others through meditation. In general, in the cycle of impure life, samsara, there is no real happiness<a id="_idIndexMarker1336"></a> at all. As mentioned previously, the happiness that we normally experience through eating, drinking, sex and so forth is not real happiness, but merely a reduction of a previous problem or dissatisfaction<a id="_idIndexMarker1337"></a>. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---space-below">How do we meditate on <a id="_idIndexMarker1338"></a>giving? In <span class="_1---Italic">Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1339"></a> <a id="_idIndexMarker1340"></a>Shantideva says:</p>

			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---meditation---single">All living beings wish to be happy all the time, but they do not know how to do this. They never experience real happiness, because out of ignorance they destroy their own happiness by developing delusions such as anger and performing non-virtuous actions. How wonderful it would be if all these living beings experienced the pure and everlasting happiness of enlightenment! May they experience this happiness. I will now give my own future happiness of enlightenment to each and every living being.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">Thinking in this way we imagine that from our continuously residing body at our heart we emanate infinite rays of light, which are in nature our future happiness of enlightenment<a id="_idIndexMarker1346"></a>. These reach all living beings of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1347"></a>six realms, and we strongly believe that each and every living being experiences the pure and everlasting happiness<a id="_idIndexMarker1348"></a> of enlightenment. We meditate on this belief single-pointedly for as long as possible. We should continually practise this meditation until we spontaneously believe that all living beings have actually received our future happiness of enlightenment now.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If we wish to meditate on giving more extensively we can imagine that the rays of light we emanate fulfil all the individual needs and wishes of each and every living being. <a id="_idIndexMarker1349"></a>Human beings receive pure environments, pure enjoyments and a pure body and mind, and a meaningful life. <a id="_idIndexMarker1350"></a>Animals receive food, secure and warm homes, and freedom from being used for enjoyment or work by human beings; <a id="_idIndexMarker1351"></a>hungry ghosts receive food and drink, and freedom from poverty; beings in the hot <a id="_idIndexMarker1352"></a>hells receive cooling breezes; and beings in the cold hells receive warm sunshine. The <a id="_idIndexMarker1353"></a>demi-gods receive peace and satisfaction, and freedom from their problems of <a id="_idIndexMarker1354"></a>jealousy; and the gods receive uncontaminated happiness and a meaningful life. Through enjoying these objects of desire all living beings are completely satisfied and experience the uncontaminated bliss of enlightenment. </p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Although we are principally training in the thought of giving, we can also engage in taking and giving in practical ways whenever we have the opportunity. At our stage we cannot take on the suffering of others through the power of our concentration, but we can often be of practical benefit to them. We can ease the pain of sick people by taking good care of them, and we can look after those who are not able to care for themselves. Accepting hardship while engaged in helping others is also a form of giving. We can also give material help, our labour, our skills, Dharma teachings or good advice. When we meet people who are depressed and need cheering up we can give our time and love.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">We can also give to <a id="_idIndexMarker1355"></a>animals. Saving insects from drowning or gently picking worms up from the road is an example of giving fearlessness, or protection. Even allowing a <a id="_idIndexMarker1356"></a>mouse to rummage through our wastepaper basket without getting irritated can be a form of giving. Animals want to be happy just as much as we do, and they need our help even more than humans. Most humans have some power to help themselves, but animals are so deeply enveloped in ignorance that they have no freedom whatsoever to improve their situation. Just as our life is important, so we should understand that the lives of animals, including insects, are also important. So we must therefore stop killing <a id="_idIndexMarker1357"></a>insects by crushing them without any thought of their suffering or loss of their life. Animals have taken rebirth in a lower state of existence than humans, but we should never regard them as less important. <a id="_idIndexMarker1358"></a>Buddhas and <a id="_idIndexMarker1359"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1360"></a>Bodhisattvas have complete <a id="_idIndexMarker1361"></a>equanimity and cherish animals and human beings equally.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">At the end of our meditation on giving we <a id="_idIndexMarker1362"></a>dedicate our merit so that all living beings may find true happiness. We can also make specific dedications, praying that the sick be restored to health, the poor obtain wealth, the unemployed find good jobs, the unsuccessful meet with success, the anxious find peace of mind, and so forth. Through the strength of our pure <a id="_idIndexMarker1363"></a>motivation and the power and <a id="_idIndexMarker1364"></a>blessings of Buddhadharma our dedications can certainly help, especially if we have a strong <a id="_idIndexMarker1365"></a>karmic link with the people for whom we are praying. Dedicating our merit to others is itself a form of giving. We can also mentally practise giving in daily life. Whenever we see or read about people who are poor, unhealthy, fearful, unsuccessful or unhappy, we can increase our wishing love for them and dedicate our merit towards their happiness and freedom from suffering.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---heading-1">MOUNTING TAKING AND GIVING UPON THE BREATH</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">Once we have become familiar with the meditations on <a id="_idIndexMarker1366"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker1367"></a>taking and giving, we can combine the two and practise them in conjunction with our breathing. We begin by meditating on compassion and love for all living beings, and developing a strong determination to take on their suffering and give them pure happiness. With this determination, we imagine that we inhale through our nostrils the suffering, delusions and non-virtues of all living beings in the form of black smoke, which dissolves into our heart and completely destroys our self-cherishing. As we exhale, we imagine that our breath in the aspect of wisdom light, its nature pure uncontaminated happiness, pervades the entire universe. Each and every living being receives whatever they need and desire, and in particular the supreme happiness of permanent inner peace. We practise this cycle of breathing day and night, with each breath taking on the suffering of all living beings and giving them pure happiness, until we gain a deep experience of this practice.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">Once we are proficient at this meditation on mounting taking and giving upon the breath, it is very powerful because there is a close relationship between the breath and the mind. The breath is related to the <a id="_idIndexMarker1368"></a>inner energy winds that flow through the <a id="_idIndexMarker1369"></a>channels of our body, and which act as the vehicles, or mounts, for different types of awareness. By harnessing our breath for virtuous purposes, we purify our inner winds and, when pure winds are flowing through our channels, pure minds arise naturally.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para---full-space-below">Many people practise <a id="_idIndexMarker1370"></a>breathing <a id="_idIndexMarker1371"></a>meditation, but the most widely practised type consists simply of concentrating on the sensation of the breath entering and leaving the nostrils. This serves to calm the mind temporarily and reduces <a id="_idIndexMarker1372"></a>distracting thoughts, but it does not have the power to effect a deep and lasting transformation of our mind. Combining breathing meditation with the practice of taking and giving, however, has the power to transform our mind from its present miserable and self-centred state into the blissful and altruistic mind of a Bodhisattva. It improves our concentration, makes our love and compassion very strong, and accumulates vast merit. In this way, the simple act of breathing is transformed into a powerful spiritual practice. At first we do this practice only in meditation, but with familiarity we can do it at any time. Through deep <a id="_idIndexMarker1373"></a>familiarity with this practice, our mind will eventually transform into the compassion of a Buddha.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---1st-para">Meditating on <a id="_idIndexMarker1374"></a>taking and giving can also be very effective in curing disease. By taking on the <a id="_idIndexMarker1375"></a>sickness and suffering of others with a mind of compassion, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker1376"></a>purify the negative karma that causes the continuation of our disease. Although we should always seek medical advice when we are ill, there may be times when doctors are unable to help us. There are many stories in Tibet of people curing themselves of otherwise incurable diseases through sincerely meditating on taking and giving. There was a meditator called <a id="_idIndexMarker1377"></a>Kharak Gomchen who contracted a disease that doctors were unable to cure. Thinking that he was going to die, he gave away all his possessions as offerings to <a id="_idIndexMarker1378"></a>Avalokiteshvara, the Buddha of Compassion, and retired to a cemetery, where he intended to make the last few weeks of his life meaningful by meditating on taking and giving. However, through his practice of taking and giving he purified the karma that was perpetuating his illness, and, much to everyone’s surprise, returned home completely cured. This shows us how powerful the practice of taking and giving can be.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para">If we purify our negative karma, it is easy to cure even the heaviest disease. My mother told me about a monk she met who had contracted <a id="_idIndexMarker1379"></a>leprosy. Hoping to purify his sickness, he made a pilgrimage to Mount Kailash in western Tibet, which Buddhists believe to be Buddha <a id="_idIndexMarker1380"></a>Heruka’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1381"></a>Pure Land. He was extremely poor and so my <a id="_idIndexMarker1382"></a>mother helped him on his way by giving him food and shelter, which was very kind as most people avoided lepers out of fear of catching leprosy. He stayed around <a id="_idIndexMarker1383"></a>Mount Kailash for about six months, prostrating and circumambulating the holy mountain as his purification practice. Afterwards, while he was sleeping near a lake, he dreamt that many worms crawled out of his <a id="_idIndexMarker1384"></a>body and into the water. When he awoke he felt extremely comfortable, and later discovered that he was completely cured. On his way home, he stopped to see my mother and told her what had happened.</p>
			<p class="Tharpa-Book-Styles_01-Text---2nd-para _idGenParaOverride-1">We can reflect that since <a id="_idIndexMarker1385"></a>beginningless time we have had countless lives and countless bodies, but that we have wasted them all in meaningless activities. Now we have the opportunity to derive the greatest meaning from our present body by using it to engage in the path of compassion and wisdom. How wonderful it would be for our world if many modern-day practitioners could emulate the <a id="_idIndexMarker1386"></a>training the mind practitioners of ancient times and become actual <a id="_idIndexMarker1387"></a>Bodhisattvas!</p>
